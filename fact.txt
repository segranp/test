JSE-listed platinum producer Lonmin Plc said on Friday it had received consent from its banks for acquisition of the Pandora joint venture mines in Rustenburg, North West.

This comes after Lonmin agreed in May to buy 7.5?percent of Pandora mines for R45.5?million from Northam Platinum's Mvelaphanda Resources to become the 100?percent owner after having bought Anglo American Platinum's 42.5?percent equity interest in November last year.

The venture mines platinum group metals from the UG2 and Merensky reefs, and 100?percent of the ore produced is sold to Lonmin for processing and refining. - ANA

* Tribal deals signed as mining shifts to former homelands

* Locals often feel excluded, stirring unrest

* Government backs tribal leaders, locals seek more power

By Ed Stoddard

MOGALAKWENA, South Africa, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A new power struggle is unfolding in South Africa's old homelands between global mining giants, traditional leaders and an impoverished rural populace.

Parts of an industry long used to labour unrest are now contending with community protests that have cut production of the country's largest mineral export earner, platinum, and may shut some operations down altogether.

At the heart of the conflict are tribal leaders who have royal titles and feudal-style control over the homelands, poor rural areas designated to South Africa's black majority by its former white minority rulers during apartheid.

Tribal leaders are also key allies of President Jacob Zuma, whose political base has become increasingly rural, and his African National Congress party has drafted a law that would cement their control.

But with protests spreading across the homelands, the communities, mining companies and some within the ANC itself are moving to change what they see as an anachronistic system.

The traditional leaders have acted as intermediaries with companies which have discovered chrome and coal as well as platinum in the homelands and hope to find shale gas. Many locals say they are seeing none of the proceeds.

"If they don’t give us that 175 million rand ($13 million), we are going to shut down the mine," said Chippa Langa, a leader of the community around the Mogalakwena platinum mine, referring to a community fund set up by Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) .

To avoid such an outcome, a leading human rights lawyer is negotiating with the local royal house to allow community representatives more control over the fund.

"We are renegotiating the agreement to make it more accountable," said the lawyer, Richard Spoor, whose work has included spearheading a class action suit against gold producers over the fatal lung disease silicosis which miners contract.

It is a plan that, if copied elsewhere, would dilute the power of the tribal leaders and could do the same to the ANC, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994.

But Spoor says he and his legal team, who are acting for the communities rather than the mine, are not undermining tradition.

"Our view is that this more democratic model is far more aligned with traditional law and custom. We don't regard the current very authoritarian top-down style of chieftanship as consistent with the traditional institution."

Zolani Mkiva, head of presidency at Contralesa, the umbrella group for South Africa's traditional leaders, agreed that the African way is bottom up, but said what he called isolated cases involving some mining deals were giving the chiefs a bad name.

"They tend to attract attention and create an impression that this represents the African way of leadership," he said.

Chris Griffith, chief executive of Amplats, a unit of Anglo American, said the company was fully behind the restructuring of the community trust and was applying the lessons learned to other deals.

"What we are trying to do is get away from some of the previous structures where we felt obliged to pay the money over to the Kgoshi (chief)," Griffiths told Reuters, noting a new-style deal on a chrome project in February. At that project, there have been no protests so far.

LAND RIGHTS

Discontent has not been confined to Mogalakwena, the world's largest open-pit platinum mine, where Amplats says protests two years ago cost it 8,600 ounces of its annual 200,000-plus ounces of production.

Impala Platinum's Marula mine says it lost 10,000 ounces of almost 80,000 ounces of production in the last financial year to community protests that included road blocks, vehicle stonings and assaults on people reporting for work.

A nearby chrome project it set up with a tribal council - made up of a chief and his aides - has collapsed and Impala says it may soon have to close Marula, which would be the first such shutdown in South Africa linked purely to social upheaval.

Falling platinum prices have multiplied the pressure.

Implats CEO Nico Muller told Reuters the company would not change the structure itself but wanted the two sides to resolve their differences. "The way they apply the proceeds is perceived not to benefit the broader community," he said.

Around Mogalakwena, set amid rust-tinged rocky outcrops in sweltering latitudes north of Johannesburg, resentment over grinding poverty runs deep.

"I never worked in the mine. I never got benefit, nothing," said 57-year-old Leg Phalanea as he walked down a dusty street near the mine.

The bill before parliament formalises the current political system in the homelands with a clause allowing traditional councils to enter partnerships with any "body or institution". It says such deals "must be beneficial to the community represented by such council", but does not require consultation.

However, Richard Mdakane, an ANC MP who chairs the parliamentary committee on traditional matters, said villagers should have more say. "We are amending many clauses that were there just to make sure that the bill allows community participation in these processes," he said.

Some in the ANC are seeking to go further by ending the chief's role as custodians of land now regarded as communal by giving villagers title deeds to the land they plough.

ANC Treasurer Secretary Zweli Mkhize - seen as a contender to replace Zuma as party chief at a December conference where policy positions will also be adopted - told Reuters: "We are discussing this issue. There is a huge discussion about what kind of land tenure we need in the former homelands."

Tribal power is already ebbing in places such as Mogalakwena. Villagers there have agreed a new trust structure with four trustees: one from Amplats, one independent, and the other two from the royal Mapela clan, to replace a structure dominated by the tribal council.

Former chief Kgabagare Langa, who has been ousted in a dispute, said he is challenging his removal in court. The new chief, or Kgoshi, Hans Langa, said he could not comment on the restructuring as his lawyers were working on it.

Residents say they have received positive signals from the new chief's camp and Amplats' Griffith said the company was just waiting for him to settle in.

"It's clear the new Kgoshi will want to see peace in Mapela," said Jonathon Manamela, 53, treasurer of the Mapela Executive Committee, a community group involved in the talks. "Our culture believes you are a king because of the people." ($1 = 13.5818 rand)

Commodities trading and mining giant Glencore plc yesterday struck a deal to buy Chevron's South African and Botswana assets for a combined $973 million.

Under the deal, Glencore will buy Chevron's 75 per cent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests.

The remaining 25 per cent stake will continue to be held by a consortium that includes Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.

The combined business made $138 million in pre-tax profits last year.

The Switzerland-based company intends to fund the acquisition through cash reserves and is expected to close in mid-2018.

Chevron had kicked off the sale of its South African and Botswana assets in early 2016 due to weak oil prices.

In March, Chevron agreed to sell these assets to China's Sinopec for nearly $1 billion, but the deal went under extended review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry and local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal (See: <strong>Sinopec to buy 75% in Chevron's South Africa and Botswana assets for nearly $1 bn</strong> (/companies/companies_c/Chevron/20170323_refinery.html)).

Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months.

Glencore believes that the assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of the local management team and workforce.

The transaction is conditional on the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.

Glencore to acquire Chevrons South Africa, Botswana assets for $973m

JSE-listed Glencore has entered into an agreement with Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six (OTS) to acquire a 75% interest in Chevron South Africa, as well as a 100% interest in Chevron Botswana, for an aggregate consideration of $973-million.

The assets comprise the interests of the Chevron group in its manufacturing, retail and industrial supply business in South Africa and Botswana.

Glencore believes the assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings to retain the local management team and workforce, the company said in a statement.

The consideration will be payable in cash on closing and will be funded from Glencore`s own cash resources.

Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500-million over the next 12 months, consistent with the groups conservative financial framework targets.

Chevron in 2016 announced plans to sell its stake in Chevron South Africa, which operates a 110 000 bl/d refinery in Cape Town.

It agreed, in March 2017, to sell its stake in the South African and Botswana assets to Chinas Sinopec for nearly $1-billion.

However, OTS has since exercised its pre-emptive right to acquire the assets from Chevron. Glencore will support OTS as technical and financial partner during the acquisition process.

The remaining 25% interest in Chevron South Africa is held by an empowerment partner.

Glencore may seek partner for $973m swoop on Chevron SA assets

GLENCORE has made light of the regulatory and political crisis in South Africas resources sector by offering nearly $1bn (R13.7bn) for control of US group Chevrons southern Africa downstream oil and lubricants business.

The eventual cheque Glencore may write for the assets, however, could well be below $500m if it introduces a partner to assist it with the transaction. The group also said it was actively managing its oil and petroleum portfolio.

The Swiss-headquartered group said in an announcement today it would spend $973m in cash buying a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa which has crude oil input capacity of some 100,000 barrels per day at its Cape Town refinery, as well as a trading team, and a separate lubricants manufacturing plant in Durban.

Chevron also has a retail-facing, forecourt business through the Caltex brand with more than 845 service stations in South Africa. In terms of synergies, the group could feasibly supply its sub-Saharan mines as far as the Democratic Republic of Congo from the South Africa facilities. There were also potential east-west oil trading opportunities, especially given the geographic positioning of Cape Town.

The assets, which generated some $138m (R1.9bn) in pre-tax profits for Chevrons 2016 financial year, will be bought from Off The Shelf Investments, an entity owned by the empowerment partners of Chevron South Africa.

Chevron was to sell its southern Africa business to Sinopec provided the empowerment grouping did not exercise its pre-emptive right. The opportunity Glencore has seized is to assist the empowerment partners, which include long-standing black entrepreneur Mashudu Romano (previously of African Harvest and African Legend Investments), exercise the pre-emptive right. The empowerment grouping also has Lithemba Investments as a shareholder which counts South Africas former mines minister, and retired African National Congress MP, Ngoaka Ramalthodi, as a beneficiary.

Glencore believes that the assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business, the company said in an announcement earlier today. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of the local management team and workforce, it said.

The transaction is another example of the groups confidence in certain segments of the resource asset class, and in southern Africa in particular, where investment has been thin on the group amid concerns over corruption, political in-fighting, and the poor regulatory and business environment.

For instance, amendments to the Minerals & Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) agreed between Government and the Chamber of Mines some 24 months ago are currently being scrutinised by the upper house of South Africas parliament. A proposal to separate oil and petroleum from minerals has been ditched.

Introducing a partner

The proposed transaction brings Glencores cash transactions just this week to more than $1.5bn after it announced on October 4 it would buy a further 27% stake in Volcan Compaia Minera for $531m, equal to $1.215 per share. This would take Glencores ownership in the Peruvian miner to 44.84%, giving it a controlling stake. The business consists of four operating units that produce some 270,000 tonnes of zinc annually with silver by-product credits totaling 18 million ounces a year.

One quibble is that the recent spate of acquisitions could crimp Glencores ability to continue paying dividends as it said it would.

Goldman Sachs said of the Chevron deal today that whilst it was not a particularly large transaction for Glencore from a balance sheet perspective, its acquisitions were starting to add up. Including the Volcan transaction, Glencores net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) would be 1.72x compared to the banks estimate for 2017 of 1.6x Ebitda. This in our view could make investors slightly cautious on the potential to ramp up dividends, it said.

However, Glencore said the it would manage its overall oil asset portfolio such that net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500m over the next 12 months. This would suggest Glencore may offset the $973m investment in Chevrons southern Africa business by introducing a partner of its own. Charles Watenphul, spokesman for Glencore, said the company did not comment on market speculation.

Glencore said earlier this year it would sell 51% of its oil products storage facilities to Chinese conglomerate HNA for $775m.

South African mining industry still not spending enough on R&D

While South Africa has increased its investment in mining research and development (R&D) since 2014, the countrys investment is still below that of its peers, delegates heard during a panel discussion on Technological Innovation and Advancements in the Mining Industry at the Joburg Indaba, on Thursday.

Despite R100-million having been set aside for mining R&D for 2018 a marked improvement from R5-million in 2014 other developing mining countries spend between R4-billion and R5-billion a year on R&D.

It was also underscored by Mining Precinct mining research director Alastair McFarlane that achieving the organisations goal of increasing investment in R&D in South Africas mining industry was only achievable with the help of industry and government.

It is a true partnership that we have to innovate, McFarlane stressed.

With several discussions at the Joburg Indaba conference having placed emphasis on the need for collaboration, meaningful communication and greater stakeholder involvement, McFarlane noted that, with the establishment of the precinct, which is funded by the departments of Science and Technology and Trade and Industry, as well as the mining industry, the sector is in the position to say it has moved to action.

Anglo American NMT Platinum head Frik Fourie agreed that there was a need for more action and less talk. He also averred that everyone tries to do their own [thing] and spends . . . money on different technologies and innovations, failing to work together to find solutions.

. . . we need to find a solution for the here and now, he stressed.

Fourie suggested that, in considering new technological innovations and developments, the mining industry should not only look at the production of a material or product, but also consider how that product can be taken down the value chain and be improved upon.

Department of Science and Technology mining and minerals beneficiation director Llanley Simpson believes partnerships with industry associations are key to improving R&D in the mining industry.

He questioned the contributions of industry associations and the potential of leveraging partnerships with other mining companies, as well as suppliers and original-equipment manufacturers to advance R&D and to innovate in technological developments.

Meanwhile, asked whether South Africa was lagging behind the world in terms of mining and in technological advancements, KPMG mining global head Jacques Erasmus dismissed the notion, noting that some of the ideas from South Africa are just as good as those from Australia for example.

He suggested that, while South Africa is not lagging in initiative, the challenge may be a lack of capital to bring ideas to fruition.

DRA Group CEO Wray Carvelas added that companies in South Africa may need to play catch-up in terms of collaborating with other companies to drive technological innovations.

He believed efficiency and productivity improvements were in the hearts of technologies.

We have seen the recent market pressures, [which] has further reinforced the need to improve efficiencies, which will further enhance profitability, and I believe that digital technologies will play a key role in enhancing and improving efficiency across the industry, not just in South Africa, but worldwide, he stressed.

Carvelas noted that global mining companies are starting to shift their strategies to embrace digital technologies, at a faster pace than ever before.

This fundamental shift has the potential to transform the safety outcomes, to enhance efficiencies and, ultimately, unlock new opportunities for the mining industry, he said.

He also underscored the concept of the digital mine, noting that it is something DRA is working towards; an interconnected system across all the knowledge areas within an enterprise and across the entire value cycle.

. . . we have opportunities to reduce the risk and make better investments by using the digital techniques, discrete event simulations and various algorithms to create the digital mine in advance of [starting] mining operations, he said.

Carvelas noted that challenges could be overcome through extensive collaboration.

We can get there, it will take strong leadership, partnerships and collaboration for us to unlock this key value for our industry . . . and this can only happen if we embrace a culture of learning and innovation across all levels of our industry, instead of only across the levels of our companies, he said.

Glencore pays $1bn for Chevron's south African oil unit

GLENCORE is to spend $973m (£743m) buying a majority stake in Chevron's oil assets in South Africa and Botswana, just days after shoring up its grip on a Peruvian zinc miner.

Under the deal, Glencore will take 75pc ownership of Chevron's refineries, pipelines and petrol stations in the two southern African countries; the combined business made $138m in pretax profits last year.

The remainder of the business will continue to be held by its current owner, Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six, a group that was encouraged to buy up assets under South Africa's economic empowerment rules designed to support historically impoverished communities.

Glencore's investment is a vote of confidence in South Africa at a time when many foreign investors are wary of political turmoil in the ruling ANC party.

The FTSE 100 group already has extensive holdings in the country, and said that the Chevron assets would "provide an attractive downstream opportunity" for its oil business. Switzerland-based Glencore has benefited from rising commodity prices in the last year, boosting its profits and allowing it to engage in a series of "opportunistic" deals. Earlier this week it spent around $530m shoring up its holding in Peruvian miner Volcan, while in the summer it acquired a $1.1bn stake in coal mines in Australia formerly owned by Rio Tinto.

The Chevron deal will be funded from Glencore's cash reserves.

The company said the net outlay would be closer to $500m once it received proceeds from the $775m sale of its oil products storage business, announced in March. Ivan Glasenberg, the chief executive and a major shareholder, is keen to prove to the market that despite its spending spree Glencore is operating under a "conservative financial framework", having been forced to raise funds from shareholders in 2015 during the depths of a commodities downturn. The miner will keep the existing management in place. It is understood it could seek a partner to take on a share of the business down the line.

Shares fell 0.9pc to close at 366.9p.

Diversified miner Glencore PLC agreed on Friday to buy a 75 percent stake in multinational energy corporation Chevron South Africa and certain related interests and the entire stake of Chevron Botswana from Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six for US$973 million.

Chevron is a refiner and marketer of petroleum products in South Africa. The assets comprise the interests of the Chevron group in its manufacturing, retail and industrial supply business in South Africa and Botswana.

Chevron South Africa has a crude oil refinery in Cape Town that produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and other products for South Africa. The refinery, which has a crude oil input capacity of 100 000 barrels per day, also exports to other African countries.

In addition, Chevron South Africa has a lubricants manufacturing plant in Durban and maintains a laboratory and blending plant there. The company markets its products in South Africa under the Caltex brand, which has more than 845 service stations nationwide.

In March 2017, Chevron signed an agreement to sell its interests in the Cape Town Refinery, along with the marketing and lubricants businesses in South Africa, pending regulatory approval.

Glencore said it believes that the assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of the local management team and workforce.

During its acquisition process Glencore will be supporting Off The Shelf as their technical and financial partner. The consideration will be payable in cash on closing and will be funded from Glencore's own cash resources.

Glencore said it intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than US$500m over the next 12 months, consistent with Glencore's conservative financial framework targets.

The transaction is conditional on the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals by Off The Shelf and Glencore, and is expected to close in mid-2018.

$100m at stake, says Gold Fields

WA’s second-biggest gold miner is in a game of brinkmanship with the McGowan Government over the gold royalty hike.

In a dramatic escalation of the gold tax war, South Africa’s Gold Fields warned yesterday it was reviewing its $100 million annual exploration expenditure in WA in light of the Government’s proposed 50 per cent royalty increase.

The company, which employs more than 2200 staff and contractors in WA across three mines and one development project, announced yesterday it had no option but to claw back the $20 million impact of the lift in the royalty rate from 2.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent.

Gold Fields accounts for about 30 per cent of Australia’s gold exploration expenditure and produces 900,000oz a year — second only to American giant Newmont.

Gold Fields executive vice-president Australasia, Stuart Mathews, said the Government was ignoring the reality that mines were getting deeper and more expensive to operate.

“It is an industry based on small margins, and the royalty will significantly erode those margins — something has to give,” he said.

Treasurer Ben Wyatt said Gold Fields was a multinational gold mining company which had engaged high-priced public relations firms to avoid paying its fair share for WA resources.

“It borders on offensive that a company worth $4.5 billion would say to WA families that they are not interested in doing their fair share but rather leave the heavy lifting of Budget repair to mums and dads and public servants,” he said.

UPDATE: Glencore to buy Chevron's downstream assets in South Africa, Botswana

* Marks Glencore's sole refining asset

* Glencore new buyer after Sinopec bows out

* Deal includes 110,000 b/d Cape Town refinery

(Adds detail, rewrites throughout)

Trading and mining group Glencore has agreed to buy majority stakes in Chevron's downstream oil business in South Africa and Botswana in a near $1 billion cash deal which hands the commodity giant its sole refining asset.

Switzerland-based Glencore said Friday it will acquire a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa along with purchasing the whole of Chevron's Botswana unit, expanding its footprint in the African oil sector.

The $973 million deal in South Africa will include Chevron's 110,000 b/d refinery in Cape Town, along with its retail fuel business which includes about 800 Caltex-branded service stations as well as lubricant plant and oil storage units.

"The assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of the local management team and workforce," it said in statement.

The refining acquisition marks a departure for the Swiss commodity group which, until now has lagged its global oil trading peers such as Vitol and Trafigura in snapping up refining assets shed by the oil majors over the last decade to benefit from logistical advantages from storage and distribution networks.

The rise of the so-called asset-backed trading model has come at a time when oil traders have increasingly struggled to maintain margins from their traditional trading desks.

Vitol, in particular, has expanded its presence in the West African downstream oil sector after it acquired an equity stake in Oando's downstream business.

Earlier hits year, Glencore was reportedly linked to a joint bid with US private equity investor Carlyle Group for Samir, the owner of Morocco's sole refinery at Mohammedia.

Samir was forced to halt processing at the 200,000 b/d plant in 2015 after crude oil deliveries were delayed due to financial problems. It said at the time it was not permanently closing the site and would look at increasing its capital. In May, Glencore pledged to invest $1 billion on midstream and downstream assets in Mexico with Mexican service station owners group G500. A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment on a potential bid for the Mohammedia plant and said the current deal will mark the group's first refinery in Africa. "We're not green to refining," he said, adding that Glencore had previously participated as an equity partner in refining assets but was unable to give furthers detail.

SINOPEC EXIT

Glencore is one of the world's biggest oil traders, and the Chevron deal will establish trading logistics in one of Africa's biggest economies. Glencore is active in the West African crude market, and a regular marketer of Doba crude from the Kribi terminal in Cameroon. It is also a modest producer of oil with upstream assets in Chad and Equatorial Guinea.

The southern Africa deal comes more than six months after China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, agreed to buy Chevron's units in the two African nations.

But that deal fell through due to opposition from a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust which hold a 25% interest in Chevron South Africa.

Chevron put the majority stake in its South African downstream businesses up for sale early last year as part of planned asset sales to help strengthen its balance sheet during the oil price slump.

A number of companies were reportedly bidding for the assets including trading groups Vitol and Gunvor as well as French oil major Total. South Africa's Sasol, the world's largest gas-to-fuel producer, said it was also considering buying the majority stake.

SOUTH AFRICAN REFINING

The sale could provide a much-needed impetus to South Africa's refining sector, which has been stunted by underinvestment, leaving the country heavily reliant on refined product imports.

Chevron's Cape Town refinery produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and other products for South Africa and also exports to other African countries, according to Chevron's website.

Many refineries in South Africa, however, need to be upgraded particularly as the region pushes toward using refined products with a lower sulfur content.

Glencore sold 911 million barrels of crude oil last year, an increase of 61% from 2015 when it sold 566 million barrels.

In the oil products segment, volumes sold were 844 million barrels, up 33% from 634 million barrels in 2015.

The acquisition of the Chevron assets is expected to be finalized by mid-2018.

* Glencore agrees to buy assets for $973 mln

* Glencore looking to bring in partner for the stake - source (Adds Chevron comment in par 4)

By Julia Payne and Zandi Shabalala

LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China's Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron's South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors.

The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.

In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron's 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

An industry source familiar with Glencore's mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.

A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.

In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China's largest refiner Sinopec, for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry.

Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor.

END OF ERA

The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.

Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.

Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016.

Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrialising nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand.

Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices.

The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron's local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018.

"Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months," it said.

If the deal closes, this would be Glencore's first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico. (Additional reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru and Dmitry Zdhannikov in London; editing by Keith Weir and Elaine Hardcastle)

October 6 (SeeNews) - Swiss miner Glencore (LON:GLEN) said Friday it has agreed to buy US oil giant Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) assets in South Africa for a total cash consideration of USD 973 million (EUR 832m).

Under the terms of the agreement, Glencore will acquire a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa Proprietary Ltd and the entire share capital of Chevron Botswana Proprietary Ltd.

The majority stake in Chevron SA will be purchased from a consortium of black economic empowerment partners -- Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six (RF) Proprietary Limited (OTS). The transaction became possible after OTS exercised of its pre-emptive right to acquire the assets from Chevron.

Chevron initially agreed in March to sell the 75% stake to China Petroleum & Chemical for about USD 900 million. Other shareholders and employees, represented through the consortium and holding a 25% stake in the business, however, exercised their preemptive right andrestarted the auction.

According to various media reports at the time, apart from China Petroleum, Chevron's assets had also attracted bids from Glencore, French oil and gas company Total and Swiss commodity trading company Gunvor.

The assets to be acquired represent Chevron’s interest in its manufacturing, retail an industrial supply business in South Africa and Botswana and include a medium complexity refinery in Cape Town, a finished lubricants blend plant and base oil terminal in Durban, petrol stations and other oil storage facilities.

The assets in question have generated in 2016 combined pre-tax profit of USD 138 million, according to the statement.

Glencore in a statement described the deal as an attractive opportunity to boost its oil business. The Swiss giant intends to fund the purchase through available cash.

Subject to regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the middle of 2018.

The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse has laid charges of corruption against Eskom’s former head of generation and current interim CEO‚ Matshela Koko.

Koko is accused of using his position at Eskom to assist the controversial Gupta family to buy Optimum Coal Holdings and its Optimum and Koornfontein mines from Glencore‚ by assisting in putting financial pressure on Glencore to force the sale‚ Outa said in a statement on Thursday.

Koko was head of generation from October 2015 until his appointment as acting CEO in December 2016.

In May 2017 he was suspended following an exposé by the Sunday Times that revealed he had funnelled more than R1-billion in contracts to a company of which his stepdaughter was a shareholder.

“Optimum had a coal supply agreement with Eskom and had been involved in a dispute over the quality of the coal and over the contract‚ which forced Glencore to sell its coal to Eskom at a huge loss.”

Optimum went into business rescue in August 2015 after Eskom issued a final demand for R2.1-billion in penalties.

By December a purchase agreement was signed for the sale of Optimum to the Guptas’ Tegeta company for R2.1-billion‚ to be finalised by 30 March 2016.

Outa said Koko “engineered a coal emergency”, so allowing Eskom to conclude supply agreements with Tegeta. — Staff reporter

A COMPLAINT of corruption has been laid against suspended former acting Eskom chief executive Matshela Koko by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa).

Koko was accused of using his position at Eskom to assist the controversial Gupta family to buy Optimum Coal Holdings and its Optimum and Koornfontein mines from Glencore‚ by putting financial pressure on Glencore to force the sale‚ Outa said yesterday.

Koko was head of generation from October 2015 until his appointment as acting chief executive in December last year.

However, he was suspended in May following an exposé by the Sunday Times which revealed he had funnelled more than R1-billion in contracts to a company of which his stepdaughter was a shareholder.

“Optimum had a coal supply agreement with Eskom and had been involved in a dispute for some years over the quality of the coal supplied and over the contract‚ which forced Glencore to sell its coal to Eskom at a huge loss‚” Outa said.

Optimum subsequently went into business rescue in August 2015, a month after Eskom issued a final demand for R2.1-billion in penalties.

By December, a purchase agreement had been signed for the sale of Optimum to the Guptas’ Tegeta company for R2.1-billion‚ to be finalised by March 30 last year.

“In December‚ Koko [allegedly] engineered a coal ‘emergency’ by manipulating the coal-supply situation‚ removing Just Coal as one of its suppliers.

“Using emergency procurement procedures‚ Eskom signed new coal-supply agreements with Tegeta and‚ between January 29 and April 26 2016‚ paid Tegeta R1.2-billion on these contracts, including prepayments – a large part of this was used to fund Tegeta’s purchase of Optimum.

“Eskom also provided a R1.6-billion guarantee to Tegeta to help its funding situation.”

Despite Eskom’s assertions that the R2-billion penalty would not be waived for any new owner‚ it said in July this year that it had been reduced to just R577-million.

At the same briefing, Eskom confirmed the R1.6-billion guarantee to Tegeta. – TimesLIVE

De Beers may go to court over 54 exploration applications

DE BEERS, which will be down to a single mine in South Africa from 2020, has 54 exploration applications stuck with the Department of Mineral Resources, some for two years, and has suspended its R40-million annual exploration budget.

The focus of De Beers Consolidated Mines (DBCM), the South African subsidiary of De Beers, the world’s largest producer of rough diamonds by value, is on bringing its $2-billion (R27-billion) Venetia mine into production and managing the transition from opencast mining to underground mining, minimising the anticipated dip in production at that time, DBCM CEO Philip Barton said.

While De Beers has patiently pushed for the exploration licences to be approved, having exhausted all its other exploration permits, it is now coming to a point where taking the Department of Mineral Resources to court is being considered as an option if talks with Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane yielded no progress, Barton said on the sidelines of the Joburg Indaba mining conference.

Zwane said at a gala dinner on Tuesday night he and his department had an “open-door policy” for anyone with a problem to come and speak to them. DBCM will put this to the test, Barton said.

The department’s third iteration of the now-suspended Mining Charter said companies applying for exploration permits needed to be 51% black-owned.

De Beers would not invest in projects in which it was the minority partner and had stopped the exploration budget for DBCM for this year and next until the company received permits. — DDC

NOTICE, AS REQUIRED IN TERMS OF SECTION 45(5) (a) OF THE COMPANIES ACT,
71 OF 2008 (THE ACT) FOR THE GRANTING OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE


In terms of the provisions of section 45(5)(a) of the Act, and pursuant to a special resolution
passed by shareholders authorising the board of directors ("the board") to provide direct or
indirect financial assistance to a related and inter-related company or corporation (or any
future related or inter related company or corporation), notification is hereby given by the
Company that the board adopted a resolution in terms of sections 45(3)(b) and 45(4) of the
Act, authorising the Company to grant financial assistance to an inter-related company.


Shareholders are advised that, the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa
Limited (the "IDC") has approved partial funding for the first phase of the Master Drilling
Blind Shaft Boring System (the "BSBS") development, with roll-out of the project expected to
take place in 2019.


The BSBS allows for cost-effective and safe access to the ore bodies at great depths and
situated in hard substrate. With the entire operation conducted without the need for blasting,
noise or fumes which are no longer a feature of the drilling process, and environmental
impact is minimal.


As part of the arrangements envisaged above, which include co-financing by the IDC, the
Company shall provide proportional funding (the "financial assistance") in the amount of R19
840 000.00 (Nineteen Million Eight Hundred and Forty Thousand Rand) to Master Sinkers
(Pty) Ltd with registration number 2000/016508/07 ("MS") presently a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, with the IDC providing a like amount.

                                                                                                 
In accordance with section 45 of the Act, the board is satisfied and acknowledges that:


   i)      immediately after providing such financial assistance, the Company would have
           satisfied the solvency and liquidity test as provided for in section 4 of the Act; and
   ii)     the terms under which such financial assistance would be given are fair and
           reasonable to the Company.


Further opportunities to develop home-grown technologies that support cost-effective, simpler
and improved drilling systems are also being explored with the IDC.

Glencore to buy stakes in Chevron's units in South Africa, Botswana

* Glencore emerges as new buyer after Sinopec deal folds

* Deal includes Chevron's 110,000 b/d refinery in Cape Town

Commodity trader and mining company Glencore said Friday it has agreed to buy majority stakes in Chevron's downstream oil business in South Africa and Botswana in a $973 million cash deal, as it hopes to expand its footprint in the African oil sector.

The news comes more than six months after China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, agreed to buy Chevron's units in the two African nations.

But that deal fell through due to opposition from a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust which hold a 25% interest in Chevron South Africa.

Glencore confirmed it will acquire a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa along with purchasing the whole of Chevron's Botswana unit and expects the deal to be finalized by mid-2018.

The deal in South Africa will include Chevron's 110,000 b/d refinery in Cape Town, along with its retail fuel business which includes about 800 Caltex-branded service stations as well as lubricant plant and oil storage units.

"The assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of the local management team and workforce," it said in statement.

This development could provide a much needed impetus to South Africa's refining sector which has been stunted by underinvestment, leaving the country heavily reliant on refined product imports.

Chevron's Cape Town refinery produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and other products for South Africa and also exports to other African countries, according to Chevron's website.

Glencore is one of the world's biggest oil traders, and this deal will give it access to one of Africa's biggest economies.

Many refineries in South Africa, however, need to be upgraded particularly as the region pushes toward using refined products with a lower sulfur content.

Glencore sold 911 million barrels of crude oil last year, an increase of 61% from 2015 when it sold 566 million barrels.

In the oil products segment, volumes sold were 844 million barrels, up 33% from 634 million barrels in 2015.

Glencore is also a modest producer of oil with upstream assets in Chad and Equatorial Guinea.

Chevron put the majority stake in its South African downstream businesses up for sale early last year as part of planned asset sales to help strengthen its balance sheet during the oil price slump.

   Proposed acquisition of shareholdings in Chevron South Africa and Chevron
                                   Botswana


Glencore has entered into an agreement with Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six (RF) Proprietary Limited
(OTS) to acquire from OTS (i) a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa Proprietary Limited (Chevron SA)
and certain related interests and (ii) the entire issued share capital of Chevron Botswana Proprietary
Limited (Chevron Botswana) (together the Assets and these companies together the Companies)
following closing of OTS's exercise of its pre-emptive right to acquire the Assets from the Chevron group.
During its acquisition process Glencore will be supporting OTS as their technical and financial partner.
The aggregate consideration (subject to adjustment for debt and working capital of the Companies at
closing) is US$973 million.

The Assets comprise the interests of the Chevron group in its manufacturing, retail and industrial supply
business in South Africa and Botswana. Glencore believes that the Assets provide an attractive
downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of
the local management team and workforce.

The consideration will be payable in cash on closing and will be funded from Glencore's own cash
resources. Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this
transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than US$500m over the next 12 months,
consistent with Glencore's conservative financial framework targets.


The transaction is conditional on the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals by OTS and Glencore
and is expected to close in mid-2018. A further announcement will be made in due course.

Business
Glencore to spend $1bn on Chevron’s southern African oil assets

Glencore is to spend $973m (£743m) buying a majority stake in Chevron’s oil assets in South Africa and Botswana, just days after shoring up its grip on a Peruvian zinc miner.

The deal will see Glencore take 75pc ownership of Chevron’s refineries, pipelines and petrol stations in the two southern African countries; the combined business made $138m in pre-tax profits last year.

The remainder of the business will continue to be held by its current owner, Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six, a group that was encouraged to buy up assets under South Africa’s economic empowerment rules designed to support historically impoverished communities.

Glencore’s investment is a vote of confidence in South Africa at a time when many foreign investors are wary of political turmoil in the ruling ANC party. The FTSE 100 group already has extensive holdings in the country, and said that the Chevron assets would “provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business”.

Switzerland-based Glencore has benefited from rising commodity prices in the last year, boosting its profits and allowing it to engage in a series of “opportunistic” deals. Earlier this week it spent around $530m shoring up its holding in Peruvian miner Volcan, while in the summer it acquired a $1.1bn stake in coal mines in Australia formerly owned by Rio Tinto.

The Chevron deal will be funded from Glencore’s cash reserves. The company said the net outlay would be less than $500m once it receives proceeds from the $775m sale of its oil products storage business, announced in March.

Chief executive and major shareholder Ivan Glasenberg is keen to prove to the market that despite its spending spree Glencore is operating under a “conservative financial framework”, having been forced to raise funds from shareholders in 2015 during the depths of a commodities downturn.

The miner, which is also one of the world's largest traders of oil, will keep the existing management in place. It is understood it could seek a partner to take on a share of the business down the line.

Glencore shares were little changed in lunchtime trade, at 370p.

EXXARO REACHES COAL AGREEMENT WITH TRANSNET ON WATERBERG TO RICHARDS BAY COAL TERMINAL

South African based diversified resources company, Exxaro Resource Limited, have signed a coal export transportation agreement with Transnet which will increase coal volumes from Waterberg to Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

The 10-year agreement between Exxaro and Transnet will allow for the transportation of a total of 7,8 million tonnes (Mt) of export coal, of which 3Mt will come from the Waterberg once all the projects are ramped up, the two companies announced earlier today.

Commenting on the signing of the Agreement, Mxolisi Mgojo, Chief Executive Officer of Exxaro said: 'Exxaro is proud to be developing the Waterberg area in collaboration with Transnet. This is an exciting milestone for Exxaro and is a realisation of our vision to contributing to the unlocking of the Waterberg, thus creating jobs and powering economic development in South Africa. As such, we will be investing 50% of our R20bn coal capex programme over the next five years in coal in the Waterberg area.'

Transnet has a proven track record in building rail capacity and expanding export rail performance in the Waterberg area and across South Africa. This Agreement is testament to healthy public-private partnerships. It will also enable Transnet to increase rail infrastructure capacity to service both domestic and export markets from the Waterberg area, Mgojo added.

The new contract will also see the collapse of the old agreement between Transnet and Exxaro Resource Limited.

This fresh agreement comes at the time when the Transnet's Waterberg Programme is in full swing with plans to complete the second phase of the project in March 2019.

The Waterberg upgrade phase two will grow export rail capacity to 6Mt through incremental upgrades of the existing rail networks and yards using additional loops, while maintaining the existing axle load, electrical upgrades and improved train control systems.

The agreement is a key contribution to the Waterberg expansion programme earmarked in the National Development Plan (NDP) as a strategic coal mining area and national asset to growing the South African economy.

Welcoming the signing of the agreement, Siyabonga Gama, Transnet Group CEO said: 'We are pleased with reaching a key milestone with Exxaro to improve rail infrastructure in the Waterberg area which includes the strengthening and expansion of the Waterberg Link (the Lephalale Line).We are a key enabler to growing the South African economy and are playing our role in developing more rail capacity and unlocking the capacity of the Waterberg region to domestic and export markets.'

Exxaro's signing of the long-term agreement with Transnet will enable the GG6 expansion of the Grootegeluk operation in the Waterberg area that requires rail capacity to Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

The signing of the contract comes on the foot of the completion of first phase in the Waterberg Expansion Programme in 2016 which included a 1.8km passing loop which enables 100- wagons trains to cross without disrupting other rail operations on the line.

The specific auction mix and the exact quality of the lots offered at each auction vary in characteristics such as
size, colour and clarity on account of variations in mined production and market demand. Each auction naturally
contains a degree of variation in overall quality composition and therefore the results of each auction are not
always directly comparable.

        Sean Gilbertson, CEO of Gemfields, commented:

        "I am very pleased with the results of this auction. It was, by weight, the smallest auction of Kagem higher quality
        emeralds to date, as a result of the reduced production experienced over the past 12 months. The average price
        per carat realised was strong, constituting the second highest figure achieved to date. That outcome, and the
        fact that 100% of the gems offered were sold, underscores the enduring strength of market demand for
        responsibly sourced high quality emeralds from our Kagem mine."

        "The extraordinary "Insofu" emerald, a 6,100 carat emerald mined by Kagem on 5 February 2010, and displaying
        wonderful colour and translucency, was purchased at the auction by Rajkumar Tongya of Dia-Color, specialists
        in high-value gems. The emerald is named "Insofu" (meaning "elephant" in the vernacular of the Bemba people
        indigenous to Zambia's Copperbelt province in which Kagem is based) in consideration of its size and shape, and
        Gemfields' ongoing desire to support wildlife conservation efforts as part of its wider Corporate Social
        Responsibility programme.

        We were delighted also that the auction saw the inaugural commercial deployment of the nano-particle
        "paternity testing" technology developed by the renowned Swiss laboratory, Gubelin, as first announced by
        Gubelin and Gemfields at BaselWorld in April 2017. The nano-particles, carrying a form of synthetic DNA which
        tags the emeralds as having been mined at Kagem, allows identification of, inter alia, the mine-of-origin for
        decades to come, providing unparalleled traceability. The nano-particles were applied to the highest quality lot
        from the auction, which was won by ‘Jewel of Africa', the first ever Zambian company to win a lot at a Kagem
        auction. This means that emeralds mined in Zambia, auctioned in Zambia, cut-and-polished in Zambia and then
        mounted in jewellery in Zambia, become the first to deploy this breakthrough in traceability. Our congratulations
        go to proprietors Raj and Rashmi Sharma and we are very grateful to Gubelin for their presence at the auction in
        overseeing the process.


As always, we extend our thanks to our loyal customers, to the Government of the Republic of Zambia, and to
the hardworking Gemfields team for their sterling efforts in making this auction and the outcome possible."

As of 2012, the company holds 100% interest in 625.12km2 and drilled a total of 4,274m in 17 holes, of which 2,891m in nine holes have been drilled on this property. The Providence Copper-Nickel-Cobalt-Platinum Group Metals property is located in the Northwest Territories, Canada comprising of 13 mineral claims totaling 133.66km2.

Strong Resource and Reserve Base

Platinum Group asset portfolio enables the company to increase its revenue. The company’s mines having operations in South Africa. The mining operations are carried out through two projects: Waterberg project and Maseve project. The Waterberg project is located approximately 85km north of the town of Mokopane at the Province of Limpopo, South Africa. As of October 2016, the Waterberg has a indicated mineral resource of 218.3 million tonnes (Mt) at a cut-off grade of 2.5g/t 4E (Pt+Pd+Rh+Au) and inferred mineral resource of 97.2 Mt at a grade of 2.5g/t 4E. In addition, the project’s total mineral reserves stood at 102.7Mt at 12.3 million ounces (Moz) of 4E.

Liquidity Position

Liquidity Position

Limited cash and liquidity position puts it at a disadvantage when funding any potential opportunities in the market. Platinum Group's current ratio was 0.5 in FY2016. This was lower than its close competitors, Impala Platinum Holdings Limited (Impala Platinum) and Lonmin Plc, with respective current ratios of 2.5 and 3.6. This suggests that the company is less able to meet its short-term obligations than some of its peers. At the end of the review year, the company’s total current liabilities stood at US$43.6 million compared to US$16.4 million in 2015. Its current portfolio of long-term debt or capital leases stood at US$26.7 million in 2016.

Detailed

Technological Advancements

The company could benefit by adopting the latest technologies and equipment that are efficient and more productive. The mining industry has been witnessing the emergence of advanced technologies and equipment, which is changing the way the mining processes take place. New mining machines detect problems automatically and could be operated remotely. Improvements in mining methods, hazardous gas monitoring, gas drainage, electrical equipment and ventilation have reduced many of the risks of rock falls, explosions and unhealthy air quality. Areas that have seen advancement in technologies include surface and long wall mining, and roof bolting. This could translate into limited labor intervention and increased productivity for mining companies. The use of sophisticated sensing equipment to monitor air quality is common and has replaced the use of small canaries.

Increasing Demand for Platinum

Increasing demand for Platinum helps the company to enhance its business operations. According to the third quarter report of November 2016 by World Platinum Investment Council, the global production is estimated to increase by 2% and reach 6,070 kilo ounces (koz) in 2017. South Africa being largest producer of platinum in the world and is expected to increase the supply by 2% reaching 4,300 koz in 2017. It is projected that the demand for platinum in India will be increase due to the increase in the consumption of diesel-based automobiles. In addition, Korea and Thailand are expected to increase the demand for platinum, which is used as an auto catalyst in the automotive industry. Platinum is used in making jewelers and demand is estimated to increase by 2% reaching 2,625 koz in 2017.

Threats

Threats

Stringent South African Regulations

Illegal Mining in South Africa

Labor Strikes in South Africa

Detailed

Stringent South African Regulations

The company’s operations are subject to increasingly extensive laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, under various states, provincial and local laws, which regulate air and water quality, hazardous waste management, and environmental rehabilitation and reclamation. In South Africa, new mines and major expansions of projects need federal reviews and approvals, in addition to review and permitting requirements of their provincial and territorial jurisdiction. The mining projects are also subject to the Mineral and Energy Laws Rationalization Act, 1994 and Precious Metals Act, 2005. The mining companies are also required to meet rules and regulations of Mine Health and Safety Act, 1996. The company should abide by various regulations such as: the Labor Relations Act No 66 of 1995; • Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act No. 28 of 2002; National Heritage Resources Act No. 25 of 1999; National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act No. 39 of 2004. Furthermore, these acts may also increase the number of federal approvals for mining projects in future. Non-compliance with these strict rules and regulations could lead to enforcement, fines and penalties. With fewer chances of changes in the future, such non-compliance could materially affect the financial position and results of operation of the company.

Illegal Mining in South Africa

Illegal mining may have a major impact on the company’s business. Illegal mining may create a risk for natural resources which causes arbitrary reduction of reserves and refuse the government its revenue. As per March 2016 report of Chamber of Mines of South Africa, approximately 14,000 people including 6,000 underground and 8,000 on the surface are involved in illegal mining activities which creates a revenue loss of ZAR6 billion per annum. This may decrease the planned growth and development of the economy and cause large-scale irreversible environmental destruction

Labor Strikes in South Africa

Frequent agitations by labor unions in South Africa could pose a major threat to the company’s operations. In September 2016, more than 500 members of National Union of Mineworkers went out for a strike at Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.’s refinery in South Africa. This strike started after failing to reach a pay agreement following five rounds of talks at Impala Platinum. In May 2016, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union members also went for a strike at platinum mine of Sibanye Gold Ltd for traveling allowances, safety bonuses, drilling allowances and risk allowances. In January 2016, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) filed a notice with the National Economic Development and Labour Council to embark on a two-day strike against the new law which affects employee’s choice of provident fund and prohibits withdrawal of pensions when employees resign. The company operates major of its mines in South Africa. Occurrence of such agitations at the company’s mines could halt its operations and cause significant financial losses.

South African-based diversified resources company, Exxaro Resource Limited, have signed a coal export transportation agreement with Transnet which will increase coal volumes from Waterberg to Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

The 10-year agreement between Exxaro and Transnet will allow for the transportation of a total of 7,8 million tonnes (Mt) of export coal, of which 3Mt will come from the Waterberg once all the projects are ramped up, the two companies announced earlier today.

Commenting on the signing of the Agreement, Mxolisi Mgojo, Chief Executive Officer of Exxaro said: "Exxaro is proud to be developing the Waterberg area in collaboration with Transnet. This is an exciting milestone for Exxaro and is a realisation of our vision to contributing to the unlocking of the Waterberg, thus creating jobs and powering economic development in South Africa. As such, we will be investing 50% of our R20bn coal capex programme over the next five years in coal in the Waterberg area."

Transnet has a proven track record in building rail capacity and expanding export rail performance in the Waterberg area and across South Africa. This Agreement is testament to healthy public-private partnerships. It will also enable Transnet to increase rail infrastructure capacity to service both domestic and export markets from the Waterberg area, Mgojo added.

The new contract will also see the collapse of the old agreement between Transnet and Exxaro Resource Limited.

This fresh agreement comes at the time when the Transnet's Waterberg Programme is in full swing with plans to complete the second phase of the project in March 2019.

The Waterberg upgrade phase two will grow export rail capacity to 6Mt through incremental upgrades of the existing rail networks and yards using additional loops, while maintaining the existing axle load, electrical upgrades and improved train control systems.

The agreement is a key contribution to the Waterberg expansion programme earmarked in the National Development Plan (NDP) as a strategic coal mining area and national asset to growing the South African economy.

Welcoming the signing of the agreement, Siyabonga Gama, Transnet Group CEO said: "We are pleased with reaching a key milestone with Exxaro to improve rail infrastructure in the Waterberg area which includes the strengthening and expansion of the Waterberg Link (the Lephalale Line). We are a key enabler to growing the South African economy and are playing our role in developing more rail capacity and unlocking the capacity of the Waterberg region to domestic and export markets."

Exxaro's signing of the long-term agreement with Transnet will enable the GG6 expansion of the Grootegeluk operation in the Waterberg area that requires rail capacity to Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

The signing of the contract comes on the foot of the completion of first phase in the Waterberg Expansion Programme in 2016 which included a 1.8km passing loop which enables 100- wagons trains to cross without disrupting other rail operations on the line.

Commenting on the signing of the Agreement, Mxolisi Mgojo, chief executive officer of Exxaro said: Exxaro is proud to be developing the Waterberg area in collaboration with Transnet.

This is an exciting milestone for Exxaro and is a realisation of our vision to contributing to the unlocking of the Waterberg, thus creating jobs and powering economic development in South Africa.

As such, we will be investing 50% of our R20bn coal capex programme over the next five years in coal in the Waterberg area.

Transnet has a proven track record in building rail capacity and expanding export rail performance in the Waterberg area and across South Africa.

According to the mining house, the agreement is testament to healthy public-private partnerships.

It will also enable Transnet to increase rail infrastructure capacity to service both domestic and export markets from the Waterberg area, Mgojo added.

New agreement

The new contract will also see the collapse of the old agreement between Transnet and Exxaro Resource Limited, a company statement explained.

This fresh agreement comes at the time when the Transnets Waterberg Programme is in full swing with plans to complete the second phase of the project in March 2019, Exxaro noted.

Adding that: The Waterberg upgrade phase two will grow export rail capacity to 6Mt through incremental upgrades of the existing rail networks and yards using additional loops, while maintaining the existing axle load, electrical upgrades and improved train control systems.

The agreement is a key contribution to the Waterberg expansion programme earmarked in the National Development Plan (NDP) as a strategic coal mining area and national asset to growing the South African economy.

Siyabonga Gama, Transnet Group CEO said: We are pleased with reaching a key milestone with Exxaro to improve rail infrastructure in the Waterberg area which includes the strengthening and expansion of the Waterberg Link (the Lephalale Line).

We are a key enabler to growing the South African economy and are playing our role in developing more rail capacity and unlocking the capacity of the Waterberg region to domestic and export markets.

Expansion programme

Exxaro highlighted in a statement that the signing of the long-term agreement with Transnet will enable the GG6 expansion of the Grootegeluk operation in the Waterberg area that requires rail capacity to Richards Bay Coal Terminal. Read more...

The signing of the contract comes on the foot of the completion of first phase in the Waterberg Expansion Programme in 2016, which included a 1.8km passing loop enabling 100- wagon trains to cross without disrupting other rail operations on the line.

Exxaro closes two huge deals

Midrand, Oct. 6 -- Black-owned diversified resources company Exxaro Resource closed two big deals this week. One is a huge coal export transportation agreement with Transnet, which will increase coal volumes from Waterberg in Limpopo to Richards Bay Coal Terminal in line with the country's National Development Plan (NDP). Exxaro Resource also said yesterday it would sell at least 19.5 million shares in US titanium products company Tronox at a 7.4% discount to Wednesday's closing price as the firm looked to focus on its core mining activities. On Tuesday, the firm said it would sell 16 million shares in Tronox in a public offering and 2.4 million additional shares to underwriters, amounting to a 31.3% stake. But it later said it would sell 19.5 million shares at $22 (R300) each, which compared with the $23.75 at which the stock last traded on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

 The expected net proceeds to Exxaro will be about $412m or about $474m if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, the company said. The agreement with Transnet is a key contribution to the Waterberg expansion programme earmarked in the National Development Plan (NDP) as a strategic coal mining area and national asset to growing the South African economy. The 10-year agreement between Exxaro and Transnet will allow for the transportation of a total of 7.8 million tons (Mt) of export coal, of which 3Mt will come from the Waterberg once all the projects were ramped up, the two companies announced yesterday. Mxolisi Mgojo, CEO of Exxaro, said: "This is a realisation of our vision to contribute to the unlocking of the Waterberg, thus creating jobs and powering economic development in SA. "As such, we will be investing 50% of our R20bn coal capex programme over the next five years in coal in the Waterberg area." The agreement will enable Transnet, the state-owned freight transport and logistics company, to increase rail infrastructure capacity to service both domestic and export markets from the Waterberg area, Mgojo said. The agreement comes at the time when the Transnet's "Waterberg programme" is in full swing with plans to complete the second phase of the project in March 2019. The Waterberg upgrade phase two will grow export rail capacity to 6Mt through incremental upgrades of the existing rail networks and yards using additional loops, while maintaining the existing axle load, electrical upgrades and improved train control systems. Siyabonga Gama, Transnet Group CEO, said: "This milestone includes the strengthening and expansion of the Waterberg Link (the Lephalale Line). "We are a key enabler to growing the economy and are playing our role in developing more rail capacity and unlocking the capacity of the Waterberg region to domestic and export markets." Exxaro's signing of the long-term agreement with Transnet will enable the GG6 expansion of the Grootegeluk operation in the Waterberg area that requires rail capacity to Richards Bay Coal Terminal. The signing of the contract comes on the foot of the completion of first phase in the Waterberg Expansion Programme in 2016 which included a 1.8km passing loop which enables 100 - wagon trains to cross without disrupting other rail operations on the line, Transnet said. Exxaro is a South African-based black-empowered diversified mining company listed on the JSE and included in the Responsible Mining Index. Operations include mines in Mpumalanga and Limpopo supplying to Eskom, other domestic markets and the export markets.

During its acquisition process Glencore will be supporting OTS as their technical and financial partner. The aggregate consideration (subject to adjustment for debt and working capital of the Companies at closing) is US$973 million.

The Assets comprise the interests of the Chevron group in its manufacturing, retail and industrial supply business in South Africa and Botswana. Glencore believes that the Assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of the local management team and workforce.

The consideration will be payable in cash on closing and will be funded from Glencore's own cash resources. Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than US$500m over the next 12 months, consistent with Glencore's conservative financial framework targets.

The transaction is conditional on the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals by OTS and Glencore and is expected to close in mid-2018. A further announcement will be made in due course.

Value funds having a wild ride; Positive returns are once again elusive.

Over the past few years, investors in South African value funds have needed strong stomachs. The managers of these funds have struggled to find any kind of consistent returns.

While 2013 was a fairly good year for most of them, from mid-2014 to the end of 2015, the value style went through a period of significant underperformance. Value funds therefore recorded some large negative returns over these two years, even though the JSE essentially moved sideways.

Then came the start of 2016, and a rebound in commodity stocks that sent many value funds soaring. Many value managers carried overweight positions in counters like Glencore, Anglo American, Kumba and Impala Platinum, which massively outperformed the market last year.

So far in 2017, however, value has once again fallen out of favour. Many managers have given up some of last year's gains as commodity stocks have enjoyed more mixed fortunes, and other value opportunities have remained depressed.

The table below illustrates how five local value funds have performed year by year since 2013:

Source: Morningstar

*Note: 2017 figures are to September 30 2017

All five of these funds also sit in the lowest decile of performance for South African equity funds over the last 12 months. With the exception of the Investec Value Fund, their three- and five-year performance is also less than stellar, as the table below shows:

Source: Morningstar

What is interesting about these funds, however, is that their portfolios are starting to look very different to each other. They are clearly seeing value in very different parts of the market.

The Investec Value Fund is still heavily weighted towards mining counters. At the end of August just under 65% of its portfolio was held in basic materials stocks, with particularly big positions in Impala Platinum, Anglo American, and AngloGold Ashanti.

The Stanlib Value Fund also favours resources, with 39% of its portfolio in this part of the market. It is, however, also heavily exposed to consumer goods businesses, which really sets it apart from all the other funds listed above. It gives the sector a weighting of 21%, while none of the others hold more than 10% of their assets in these companies.

In contrast to these two, the SIM Value Fund has less than 15% of its assets in basic materials stocks. Its biggest position is offshore, to which it assigns 22% of its portfolio. Locally, it is most exposed to the financials sector.

The Cannon Equity Fund is also most exposed to financials, at 29% of its portfolio. Its most interesting holdings in this regard are in Sasfin Holdings and Peregrine.

Cannon has however been upping its resources exposure in the last few months. Specifically it has been buying Anglo American and Glencore, which are now the two biggest positions in the fund.

Perpetua sits in something of a middle ground, with relatively large exposures to both financials and basic materials, at 27% and 21% of its portfolio respectively. Its largest holding is however MTN.

To some extent these disparities show how value managers are seeing much broader potential in the current market than they have for some time. There is a much wider opportunity set for them.

So far this year, however, this value has not unlocked. The question is how much longer investors will have to wait.

Game changer or damp squib?

Midrand, Oct. 6 -- Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, otherwise known as fracking, has in the past few decades made available the gas in previously "tight" shale geologies. This has shaken up the energy sector worldwide by contributing to relatively low oil prices. Almost all the shale gas development has taken place in the US where production has increased from about 1 to nearly 16 trillion cubic feet (tcf) over the past 25 years. There are indications that shale gas may be present in a semi-desert region of South Africa known as the Karoo. The core region alone has an area of 400000km sq. If a viable gas resource were to be developed in the Karoo, what impact would it have on the global shale gas market? And how would it affect the energy economy of South Africa? A few preliminary studies have been done on the potential for shale gas in the country.

 These include a report on the technical readiness for a shale gas industry in South Africa, a strategic environmental assessment on shale gas development commissioned by the Department of Environment, which I coled, and a multi-author academic book on hydraulic fracturing in the Karoo. The research, presented at a recent conference, has led to a clearer picture of both the potential and the challenges facing shale gas extraction in South Africa. The purpose of the conference, organised by the Academy of Science of South Africa, was to map out a multidisciplinary research plan to fill the critical knowledge gaps. How much, how little? The studies to date suggest that it's increasingly unlikely that economically and technically viable gas will be found in the Karoo. First desktop estimates of gas in place at depth in the Karoo basin were hundreds of trillion cubic feet (tcf). More realistic guesses - which is what they remain, in the absence of new exploration and testing - put the upper limit for gas in the Central Karoo at about 20tcf. This is a tiny resource by global standards. In terms of energy content, 2 tcf of gas is about 40 times smaller than the known remaining coal reserves in South Africa. Conventional gas reserves offshore of Mozambique have been estimated at 75tcf. On the other hand, the continental shelf gas field off Mossel Bay located on South Africa's Garden Route, exploited and now nearly depleted, was 1tcf. A viable gas find in South Africa, even if quite small, would potentially transform the national energy economy. But making a large investment in infrastructure, regulatory tools, monitoring bodies and well-field development for a resource which may not exist is financially, politically and environmentally risky. Any decisions about how the country should proceed must therefore be based on solid research which is why efforts are under way to adopt a multidisciplinary research programme to fill in the key knowledge gaps. On top of this, good governance is a prerequisite if South Africa is to proceed to shale gas development. South Africa's energy mix South Africa's formal energy economy is dominated by coal. But that cannot continue, as the country's cheap, easily accessible coal reserves are nearing an end. Coal mining has also devastated important agricultural and water-yielding landscapes. Financial institutions are increasingly reluctant to fund new coal-burning power stations because of the impact carbon dioxide emissions are having on the global climate. As a result, coal-burning power stations are likely, over time, to be replaced by wind and solar energy, or perhaps the more expensive nuclear option. But the degree to which the country's energy supply can be based on intermittent sources like wind and sunshine depends on the availability of an energy source that can be easily switched on or off to fill the temporary shortfalls between supply and demand - like gas-fired turbines. South Africa has already decided to increase the fraction of gas in its energy mix. The only question is where to source it from. Are international imports or domestic sources, like offshore conventional gas or onshore unconventional gas, including shale gas and coal-bed methane better? Next steps The optimal approach would be to take the first exploratory steps cooperatively and in the public domain, rather than in a competitive, secretive and proprietary way. This would allow South Africa to learn about the deep geology of the Karoo and the technologies and hazards of deep drilling, even if no viable gas was found. A "virtual well-field", an imaginary but realistic computer simulation, could be developed on the basis of these findings. This would allow decision makers and the public to better understand the economic spin-offs and environmental hazards of gas development before any significant actual development occurs. The continuing low price of oil and the reduced demand for energy caused by the faltering South African economy buy the country time to do the necessary research and exploration. It can establish the appropriate regulatory environment and institutions before making rushed decisions with large potential consequences. This is a cautious, evidence-guided agenda which should be acceptable to most people who care both about national development and the quality of the environment.

Headline: Proposed acquisition of shareholdings in Chevron South Africa and Chevron Botswana

6 October 2017

Glencore has entered into an agreement with Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six (RF) Proprietary Limited (OTS) to acquire from OTS (i) a 75% stake in Chevron South Africa Proprietary Limited (Chevron SA) and certain related interests and (ii) the entire issued share capital of Chevron Botswana Proprietary Limited (Chevron Botswana) (together the Assets and these companies together the Companies) following closing of OTS’s exercise of its pre-emptive right to acquire the Assets from the Chevron group. During its acquisition process Glencore will be supporting OTS as their technical and financial partner. The aggregate consideration (subject to adjustment for debt and working capital of the Companies at closing) is US$973 million.

The Assets comprise the interests of the Chevron group in its manufacturing, retail and industrial supply business in South Africa and Botswana. Glencore believes that the Assets provide an attractive downstream opportunity for its oil business. The acquisition will include undertakings as to retention of the local management team and workforce.

The consideration will be payable in cash on closing and will be funded from Glencore’s own cash resources. Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than US$500m over the next 12 months, consistent with Glencore’s conservative financial framework targets.

The transaction is conditional on the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals by OTS and Glencore and is expected to close in mid-2018. A further announcement will be made in due course.

Platinum producer Lonmin PLC (LMI.LN) said Friday that it has received approval from its lending banks to take full control of the Pandora mine in South Africa, and consent to a request to waive one of its banking covenants.

Lonmin said its banks have consented to the previously announced acquisition of the Pandora interests of its joint-venture partners Anglo American PLC (AAL.LN) and Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM.JO). The acquisition is expected to be completed by November.

The banks approved a pre-emptive waiver of Lonmin's consolidated tangible net-worth covenants for the period from Sept. 30 to March 30, 2018. Lonmin said the waiver will allow it to focus on its operational review.

As a condition of the waiver, Lonmin has agreed to leave $200 million undrawn in its remaining revolving credit facilities during the period, and cancel further facilities of $21 million.

Lonmin said it expects its liquidity to be adequate for the waiver period thanks to having $100 million net cash at the end of the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.

Shares are up 7.75 pence, or 10%, at 81.75 pence at GMT 0834.

Takeover talk helps Anglo American dig out a rise

Callum Jones

6 October 2017

With political stability seemingly in short supply around the world, hopes that the future of South Africa's volatile leadership may soon become clearer helped to propel Anglo American higher.

The miner, which has 40 per cent of its business in the country, gained 43½p to £14.73½ last night as takeover chatter persisted.

UBS raised its target price for Anglo American from £10.50 to £13.60, highlighting the elective conference in December of the African National Congress, which has won every South African election since 1994. "The tone of the conference and the elected successor to President Zuma will likely have a large bearing on South African risk levels," it told clients.

Analysts at the Swiss broker also pointed out that Anil Agarwal, the Indian billionaire behind Vedanta Resources, recently lifted his voting stake in Anglo to 20 per cent, fuelling speculation around his intentions. While they believe this position is "unlikely to be increased in the near term," they added: "The potential for a bid for Anglo, or some of its assets (by Agarwal or others), could be a potential positive catalyst."

Antofagasta, which UBS lifted from 700p to 750p, advanced 23p to 996½p. Rio Tinto, which it revised from £37.50 to £40, climbed 64½p to £36.76.

Heightened investor concern over the future of Britain's governance pulled the pound lower. Ed Vaizey, a former Conservative minister, suggested yesterday morning that "quite a few people" in his party will want Theresa May to resign as prime minister after her ill-fated speech to the party's annual conference. There was also talk of plots forming to depose her in Westminster. Sterling's struggle lifted the FTSE 100, which is dominated by companies which report their earnings in dollars, towards record territory. It closed up 40.41 points, or 0.54 per cent, at 7,507.99; just shy of the all-time peak of 7,547.63 set in June.

Reports that Merlin Entertainments could buy part of Seaworld Entertainment lifted shares in the operator behind Thorpe Park and the London Eye by 15½p to 463¾p. Tesco also advanced 2¾p to 186½p after its interim release on Wednesday.

At the other end of the index, Barclays struggled. Exane BNP Paribas ensured that the City remained cautious over some of London's biggest financial stocks. Expectations of an interest rate rise continue to boost sentiment around the banks but analysts at Exane argued that a bigger move in longer rates and several moves in short rates were needed to trigger any appreciable impact on overall revenues. They downgraded Barclays from "outperform" to "neutral", sending it down 2¼p to 190¼p. CYBG, which it cut from "neutral" to "underperform", lost 6¾p to 300½p. Aviva, which announced it had agreed to buy a majority stake in Wealthify, the online investment platform, dropped 8½p to 490¼p as it traded without entitlement to its latest dividend payout.

The FTSE 250 closed at a record high for the second time this week, having climbed 59.09 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 20,088.51. BTG, the healthcare specialist, increased 22½p to 714p after announcing that it had bought Roxwood Medical for $80 million.

Brent crude prices headed north, carrying Tullow Oil 7¾p higher, to 190¾p. Oil's latest bounce was also evident in the blue-chips, where BP rose 4¾p to 490½p and Royal Dutch Shell B picked up by 21p to £23.45.

With political stability seemingly in short supply around the world, hopes that the future of South Africa's volatile leadership may soon become clearer helped to propel Anglo American higher.

The miner, which has 40 per cent of its business in the country, gained 43½p to £14.73½ last night as takeover chatter persisted.

UBS raised its target price for Anglo American from £10.50 to £13.60, highlighting the elective conference in December of the African National Congress, which has won every South African election since 1994. "The tone of the conference and the elected successor to President Zuma will likely have a large bearing on South African risk levels," it told clients.

Analysts at the Swiss broker also pointed out that Anil Agarwal, the Indian billionaire behind Vedanta Resources, recently lifted his voting stake in Anglo to 20 per cent, fuelling speculation around his intentions. While they believe this position is "unlikely to be increased in the near term," they added: "The potential for a bid for Anglo, or some of its assets (by Agarwal or others), could be a potential positive catalyst."

Antofagasta, which UBS lifted from 700p to 750p, advanced 23p to 996½p. Rio Tinto, which it revised from £37.50 to £40, climbed 64½p to £36.76.

Heightened investor concern over the future of Britain's governance pulled the pound lower. Ed Vaizey, a former Conservative minister, suggested yesterday morning that "quite a few people" in his party will want Theresa May to resign as prime minister after her ill-fated speech to the party's annual conference. There was also talk of plots forming to depose her in Westminster. Sterling's struggle lifted the FTSE 100, which is dominated by companies which report their earnings in dollars, towards record territory. It closed up 40.41 points, or 0.54 per cent, at 7,507.99; just shy of the all-time peak of 7,547.63 set in June.

Reports that Merlin Entertainments could buy part of Seaworld Entertainment lifted shares in the operator behind Thorpe Park and the London Eye by 15½p to 463¾p. Tesco also advanced 2¾p to 186½p after its interim release on Wednesday.

At the other end of the index, Barclays struggled. Exane BNP Paribas ensured that the City remained cautious over some of London's biggest financial stocks. Expectations of an interest rate rise continue to boost sentiment around the banks but analysts at Exane argued that a bigger move in longer rates and several moves in short rates were needed to trigger any appreciable impact on overall revenues. They downgraded Barclays from "outperform" to "neutral", sending it down 2¼p to 190¼p. CYBG, which it cut from "neutral" to "underperform", lost 6¾p to 300½p. Aviva, which announced it had agreed to buy a majority stake in Wealthify, the online investment platform, dropped 8½p to 490¼p as it traded without entitlement to its latest dividend payout.

The FTSE 250 closed at a record high for the second time this week, having climbed 59.09 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 20,088.51. BTG, the healthcare specialist, increased 22½p to 714p after announcing that it had bought Roxwood Medical for $80 million.

Brent crude prices headed north, carrying Tullow Oil 7¾p higher, to 190¾p. Oil's latest bounce was also evident in the blue-chips, where BP rose 4¾p to 490½p and Royal Dutch Shell B picked up by 21p to £23.45.

SUSPENDED Eskom acting chief executive Matshela Koko has vowed to fight criminal charges laid against him by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa), but he wouldn't say on what basis.

"I am aware of the criminal charges against me and I will defend myself," he said yesterday.

Outa filed charges against Koko, accusing him of having assisted the Guptas to buy Optimum Coal Holdings, which was owned by Glencore.

In their affidavit to the police, Outa chief operating officer Ben Theron gave the police supporting evidence in the form of the #Guptaleaks emails, claiming that prior to securing that deal, Koko flew to Dubai, and that the trip was allegedly fully paid for by the Gupta brothers.

Koko is accused of using his position at Eskom to help the Guptas buy Optimum Coal Holdings (OCH) and its Optimum and Koornfontein coal mines from Glencore by placing them in financial distress and helping to fund the Guptas' purchase.

Theron said Optimum had a coal-supply agreement with Eskom and had been involved in a dispute with the power utility for several years over the quality of the coal supplied and a contract that forced Glencore to sell its coal to Eskom at a huge loss.

He pointed out that Eskom fined Optimum R2.177 billion in penalties, and in July 2015, issued a legal demand for full payment.

"By that time, the Guptas had already made an anonymous offer to buy Optimum, which was rejected.

"The demand for the penalties payment was apparently the last straw financially for Optimum, which went into business rescue on August 4, 2015.

"On December 10 2015, Glencore, OCH and the business rescue practitioners signed an agreement to sell the OCH mines and assets to the Gupta businesses Oakbay Investments and Tegeta Exploration & Resources for R2.15bn.

"The deal had to be paid for and finalised by March 30 2016," Theron said.

"In December 2015, Tegeta emailed Koko, referring to the need for a prepayment confirmation and asking him 'to kindly send us a written confirmation regarding the payment for supply of coal amounting to R1 680 000 000… detailing the agreed terms and conditions'.

"In December, Koko engineered a coal 'emergency' by manipulating the coal-supply situation and removing Just Coal as one of its suppliers.

"Using emergency procurement procedures, Eskom signed new coal-supply agreements with Tegeta, and between January 29 and April 26 2016, paid Tegeta R1.2bn on these contracts, including prepayments.

"A large part of this was used to fund Tegeta's purchase of Optimum," Theron pointed out.

Koko was an Eskom executive from 2014, and from October 2015, the executive in charge of generation, including overseeing coal contracts.

Research must precede any fracking

Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, otherwise known as fracking, has in the past few decades made available the gas in previously "tight" shale geologies. This has shaken up the energy sector worldwide by contributing to relatively low oil prices. Almost all the shale gas development has taken place in the US where production has increased from about 1 to nearly 16?trillion cubic feet (tcf) over the past 25 years.

There are indications that shale gas may be present in South Africa in the semi-desert region known as the Karoo. The core region alone has an area of 400?000km². If a viable gas resource were to be developed in the Karoo, what impact would it have on the global shale gas market? And how would it affect the energy economy of South Africa?

A few preliminary studies were done on the potential for shale gas in the country. These include a report on the technical readiness for a shale gas industry in South Africa, a strategic environmental assessment on shale gas development commissioned by the Department of Environment, which I co-led, and a multi-author academic book on hydraulic fracturing in the Karoo.

The research, presented at a recent conference, has led to a clearer picture of both the potential and the challenges facing shale gas extraction in South Africa. The purpose of the conference, organised by the Academy of Science of South Africa, was to map out a multidisciplinary research plan to fill the critical knowledge gaps.

The studies to date suggest that it's increasingly unlikely that economically and technically viable gas will be found in the Karoo. First desktop estimates of gas-in-place at depth in the Karoo basin were hundreds of tcf.

More realistic guesses - which is what they remain, in the absence of new exploration and testing - put the upper limit for gas in the Central Karoo at about 20 tcf. This is a tiny resource by global standards. In terms of energy content, 20 tcf of gas is about 40 times smaller than the known remaining coal reserves in South Africa.

Conventional gas reserves offshore of Mozambique were estimated at 75 tcf. On the other hand, the continental shelf gas wellfield off Mossel Bay located on South Africa's Garden Route, exploited and now nearly depleted, was 1 tcf.

A viable gas find in South Africa, even if quite small, would potentially transform the national energy economy. But making a large investment in infrastructure, regulatory tools, monitoring bodies and field development for a resource which may not exist is financially, politically and environmentally risky.

Any decisions about how the country should proceed must therefore be based on solid research.

On top of this, good governance is a prerequisite if South Africa is to proceed to shale gas development.

South Africa's formal energy economy is dominated by coal. But that cannot continue, as the country's cheap, easily accessible coal reserves are nearing an end. Coal mining has also devastated important agricultural and water-yielding landscapes. Financial institutions are increasingly reluctant to fund new coal-burning power stations because of the impact carbon dioxide emissions are having on the global climate.

As a result, coal-burning power stations are likely, over time, to be replaced by wind and solar energy, or perhaps the more expensive nuclear option. But the degree to which the country's energy supply can be based on intermittent sources like wind and sunshine depends on the availability of an energy source that can easily be switched on or off to fill the temporary shortfalls between supply and demand - like gas-fired turbines.

South Africa has already decided to increase the fraction of gas in its energy mix. The only question is where to source it from. Are international imports or domestic sources, like offshore conventional gas or onshore unconventional gas, including shale gas and coal-bed methane, better?

The optimal approach would be to take the first exploratory steps co-operatively, and in the public domain, rather than in a competitive, secretive and proprietary way. This would allow South Africa to learn about the deep geology of the Karoo and the technologies and hazards of deep drilling, even if no viable gas was found.

A "virtual wellfield", an imaginary but realistic computer simulation, could be developed on the basis of these findings. This would allow decision-makers and the public to better understand the economic spin-offs and environmental hazards of gas development before any significant actual development occurs.

The continuing low price of oil and the reduced demand for energy, caused by the faltering South African economy, buy the country time to do the necessary research and exploration. It can establish the appropriate regulatory environment and institutions before making rushed decisions with large potential consequences.

This is a cautious, evidence-guided agenda which should be acceptable to most people who care both about national development and the quality of the environment. - The Conversation

Site visit: New Age Metals finds high-grade PGMs at River Valley

SUDBURY, ONTARIO – The optics are rarely very good when a major pulls out of a joint-venture project with a junior company.

In the case of River Valley in northwestern Ontario, now the largest undeveloped primary platinum group metals (PGM) project in Canada with 2.5 million oz. of near-surface PGMs and gold, Anglo Platinum (JSE: AMS) spent US$30 million earning a 50% stake before turning off the taps after the financial crisis struck in 2008.

Anglo Platinum was hunting globally for Bushveld-type igneous complexes and River Valley was the first one it looked at outside of South Africa. The company’s search radius went on to encompass Australia, Brazil, China and Russia.

“They were spending a lot of money because they needed to expand outside of South Africa,” explains Trevor Richardson, president and chief operating officer of New Age Metals (TSXV: NAM; US-OTC: PAWEF), which now owns 100% of the project.

What happened next, Richardson says, was beyond anyone’s control. The platinum price tanked and the South African Rand came on par with the U.S. Dollar. Suddenly, Anglo Platinum was cutting its exploration budgets around the world and at home.

“They had joint ventures in Russia, China, South America, and they pulled out of everywhere,” Richardson says. “So they didn’t pull out from River Valley for technical reasons. They pulled out for budget reasons.”

New Age Metals – which changed its name from Pacific Northwest Capital in January – eventually recovered full control of the project in January 2011, buying it back from Anglo Platinum in shares, and has been advancing River Valley on its own ever since.

While Anglo Platinum retreated from River Valley, however, the project remained of interest to two key executives at the South African mining company who had worked on the asset between 1999 and 2008, and now sit on New Age Metals’ board of directors and its advisory board.

Ron Hieber, who moved from the junior’s advisory board to its board of directors in June, was in charge of Anglo Platinum’s PGM exploration programs worldwide, and had spent many years heading up the River Valley joint venture.

His colleague, Gordon Chunnet, who is now on New Age Metals’ advisory board, spent 31 years as head of platinum geology and exploration for Anglo Platinum and is also quite familiar with the project.

“Ron and Gordon were the heads of Anglo Platinum on the technical side for 30 years at least and were instrumental in where the company’s budget was spent,” Richardson says on a mid-September tour of the River Valley project, about 100 km east of Sudbury. “They wouldn’t have come back and got involved if they didn’t believe in this project.”

Hieber says that when he originally worked on the project for Anglo Platinum, River Valley “presented potential in several ways.” Despite lower grades than what he was used to with the Bushveld ores, he says, the River Valley deposits occurred on surface and were wide enough to be mined as an open pit.

“Unlike the Bushveld ores, which are oxidized to around 30 metres depth, River Valley mineralization is fresh and therefore amenable to good recoveries right at the start of mining,” he writes in an email from his home in South Africa. “What was missing was a critical mass of mineral resource that could generate an economic return.”

Anglo Platinum’s studies showed that River Valley could be mined profitably on a working cost basis, he says, but it didn’t have enough ore to pay back the capital expenditure. That problem, however, has the potential to be resolved, Hieber believes, because the company now has “expanded targets” that “can significantly increase the resource and hence ore reserves, while still supporting open-pit mining.”

The expanded targets Hieber refers to include a new higher grade area to the north of the main deposit that the company found in 2015 and is calling the Pine Zone, potential new targets further to the north of River Valley’s main zone, as well as targets on land it acquired to the south of the main zone in July 2016 from Mustang Minerals Corp. (TSXV: MUM).

With the addition of Mustang’s ground, known as the River Valley Extension, New Age Metal’s land in the area has grown to 64 sq. km, and River Valley's strike length has increased from 12 km to 16 km. The deposit remains open at depth.

The company confirmed the Pine Zone discovery in December 2016, reporting assay results of 2.57 grams per tonne palladium and platinum over 18 metres from 169 metres downhole in hole T2-06; 1.92 grams palladium and platinum over 20 metres starting from 202 metres in hole T2-10; and 1.84 grams palladium and platinum over 17 metres from 217 metres in hole T2-11.

[caption id="attachment_1003790117" align="alignnone" width="1024"] Drill core at New Age Metals' River Valley project in Ontario. Credit: New Age Metals.[/caption]

Earlier holes at Pine Zone returned intercepts of 9 metres grading 3.909 grams palladium and platinum starting from 145 metres in hole DN002 and 16 metres of 2.05 grams palladium and platinum from 184 metres downhole in DN001.

The Pine Zone is about 140 metres from the main resource zone of the deposit and its discovery, New Age Metals says, is a testament to the success the company has had finding near-surface mineralized zones based on IP geophysical surveys and 3D geological modelling. It also underscored “the potential for discovery of similar mineralized zones in other previously overlooked areas at River Valley,” and was “an additional indication of the camp-scale potential in the under-explored region east of Sudbury.”

Since then, New Age Metals has confirmed that PGM mineralization in the Pine Zone extends to at least 300 metres below surface.

“The Pine Zone generally tends to return higher grades than the original zones that we were drilling throughout most of the exploration program,” Richard Zemoroz, the company’s project geologist, says. “It will increase our tonnage, probably add higher grade, and because it will extend the width of the intrusive at that point, or the mineralized zone, it will probably give us a more favorable stripping ratio.”

As for the River Valley Extension property, Zemoroz describes it as “under-explored.” “Mustang had it for a while and they have done some drilling and some geophysics,” he says, “but there are a lot of places that require more work before we do any drilling there.”

Surface grab samples from the River Valley Extension have returned assay values of up to 10 grams per tonne PGM, and limited drilling has returned intercepts of 1.4 grams per tonne PGM over 9 metres; 4 grams PGM over 2.1 metres; and 2.2 grams PGM over 4.5 metres.

The company’s current exploration focus is finding higher grade, near-surface mineralization in the northern part of the deposit.

In June, the company completed an induced polarization (IP) geophysical survey of the Pine Zone, which remains open along strike and at depth, and extended the IP survey to include the Banshee Zone, about 2 km to the southeast along the trend of the River Valley main zone. (In 2003, 25 holes were drilled into Banshee and surface exploration and geophysics outlined a zone of over 600 metres.)

The surface IP over the Pine Zone tested the potential for eastwards and southwards extensions, as well as the adjacent Dana North Zone. The company says there is about 2 km of untested potential for additional mineralization along the trend between the drilled extent of the Pine Zone and the under-explored Pardo Zone to the northwest.

In mid-July, New Age Metals kicked off a 5,000-metre drill program. The program will focus on follow-up drilling to further test the continuation of the Pine Zone and the Dana North Zone. The drilling is mainly exploratory and intended to test the footwall mineralization in the northern part of the property.

Late last month, the company reported drill holes from the Dana North zone. The best result was an intercept of 2.45 grams per tonne palladium, platinum and gold over 28 metres, including 7.12 grams palladium, platinum and gold over 3 metres.

“If you’re talking about the Bushveld, they’re mining widths of over one or two metres and they’re like eight grams per tonne, so that 7.12 grams over 3 metres is a really good intercept – that’s a world-class intercept,” Zemoroz says.

“We’re so excited about those results,” says Richardson. “Those are really big thicknesses, which makes it easier to mine open cast.”

River Valley, about halfway between North Bay and Sudbury, one of the largest nickel-copper-PGM sulphide mining and metallurgical centres in the world, contains 3.9 million ounces of palladium-equivalent in the measured and indicated category and another 1.2 million ounces of palladium-equivalent inferred.

The latest resource estimate, from May 2012, identified measured and indicated resources of 91.34 million tonnes grading 0.58 gram per tonne palladium, 0.22 gram per tonne platinum, and 0.04 gram gold, at a cut-off grade of 0.8 gram per tonne palladium equivalent. Inferred resources add 35.91 million tonnes grading 0.36 gram palladium, 0.14 gram platinum, and 0.03 gram gold.

The company plans to start updating the resource this fall, with drilling it has completed since 2012, and says it will embark on a preliminary economic assessment next year.

The River Valley intrusive covers 200 km within the Grenville Front tectonic zone, a 900-metre thick, mafic, sulphide-poor layered intrusion. The project’s mineralized areas all contain PGMs, gold and small amounts of copper and nickel that could count as credits at any future mine.

Metallurgical work by SGS in 2013 produced bulk sample grades of 16% copper, 2% nickel, and 189 grams per tonne PGM, and metal recoveries of 84% copper, 22% nickel, and 69% PGMs. Because it has no deleterious metals, a sulphide concentrator could effectively process material from River Valley.

The company is weighing processing options that include dense media separation to remove the sulphides. The PEA will assess various processing options.

Hieber notes that there have been advances in processing PGM ores at lower capital costs than is typical, “and if these methods work on River Valley, which is not yet known, the economics look better.”

Only about 10 million ounces of palladium are produced in any given year and most of it comes from Russia and South Africa. Richardson forecasts total demand this year will surpass 10 million ounces for the second year in a row and points to a dearth of palladium-rich projects that can fill the gap.

“There’s going to be a deficit because the mines in South Africa have become much deeper and more expensive to mine. There’s nothing new coming on line – we went through that lag period, when no one was doing exploration.”

“Several South African deposits have reached their sell-by dates (and some have been sold) and although PGM markets have lost a lot of luster, in time, the loss of South African production will express itself in improved prices,” Hieber says. “All of this suggests that there is a lot to look forward to with River Valley, where there is an experienced team in place from the president down.”

In addition to its aging mines, South Africa is not seen as a particularly appetizing jurisdiction in which to operate, Richardson argues, which could lead to more mining companies moving outside the country in search of new assets.

As proof he points to Johannesburg-listed Sibanye Gold’s US$2.2 billion acquisition in May of Stillwater Mining, the only U.S. miner of PGMs and the largest primary producer of the precious metals outside of South Africa and Russia.

“What you’re going to start seeing is those South African companies diversifying their risk and coming back to North America,” he says. “Sibanye buying Stillwater was proof — that was the first one — and I think you’ll start seeing the others begin saying if Sibanye can do that, we can too.”

“Not a lot of people know PGMs and there is only one mine in Canada,” Richardson adds, referring to North American Palladium’s (TSX: PDL; US-OTC: PALDF) Lac des Iles mine, 90 km northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario. That mine has been in production for over 20 years, and North American Palladium is the only pure play palladium producer in the world.

“If you asked anyone to name ten gold projects they could probably do it,” Richardson says, “but ask them to name ten palladium projects and I bet they couldn’t. I couldn’t!”

Richardson, a geologist, also notes that North American Palladium started off “with a similar type of scenario” to River Valley, “and then when they went underground, they started getting much better grade.”

“Now we have the opportunity to drill deeper holes, and we may or may not find the same thing. They are very similar type deposits.”

New Age Metals’ vision is that River Valley will become an open-pit mine one day, with a concentrator on site. The concentrate would then be sent to a smelter in Sudbury, where concentrates from North American Palladium’s Lac des Iles are also sent.

Jon Hykawy, president of Stormcrow Capital, says he’s impressed with New Age Metals’ team — “not just in terms of the management group but the wider group of consultants” — and says he’s seen very few projects with better infrastructure.

“I guess it’s going to come down to how well the metallurgy works and what the appetite is out in the market for a PGM project,” he says.

While the price of palladium has been rising for nearly three years in a row and currently sits at about US$930 per oz., many investors believe the move towards electric vehicles means that the longer term prospects look dim for platinum and palladium. The two metals are used in catalytic converters in gasoline-powered and diesel-powered vehicles to clean up exhaust.

But Hykawy, who has a PhD in physics, doesn’t agree. “I think a lot of people have decided the market has spoken and the solution is a battery powered car and to my mind that’s facile and silly,” he says. “The issue with batteries is they’re great at power generation but lousy at storing energy.”

“If you look at a Tesla,” he says, “you realize very quickly that not only is it an expensive vehicle, but for all of Tesla’s attempts to sugar-coat it, the car requires adaptation from the owner.”

If you are used to the idea that you can jump in your car in Montreal and drive to Toronto and when you’re ready to turn around and drive back to Montreal, you can do so whenever you like, then electric vehicles could be problematic, Hykawy says.

“Today you can probably do that drive from Montreal to Toronto and back because you’ll probably find an electric charging station, but in future, when all those charging stations are occupied, you may have a very difficult time finding a place to charge that’s convenient for you and that is also available and has a spot open to you when you want it,” he says.

“They are already seeing that impact in parts of Europe and China and this begs the question: ‘Should there be some charging system on board and what sort of charging system should it be?”

For his part, Harry Barr, New Age Metals’ founder, chairman and CEO, who has spent more than thirty years cutting deals and raising money in the mining industry, is a true believer in River Valley.

“In 2000 we had a little 5¢ stock that went to almost $5 on the strength of a brand new discovery called River Valley, and we started the largest staking rush in the history of the Sudbury mining district,” he says.

“Management has about $3 million in this personally, and a lot of that is my money, so this has become a personal thing to me and I do want it to work.”

Of the company’s roughly 2,000 shareholders, 10.08% are management and insiders, 10.23% is owned by merchant bank Palisade Global Investments, and 1.32% by Kaymin Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo Platinum.

The junior has 68.5 million shares common shares outstanding and it has been trading within a 52-week range of 5¢ and 15¢ per share. At press time its shares were trading at 6¢ apiece.

Gruyere could provide $100m a year, US forum hears

Justin Osborne has assured the global gold mining community Gold Road Resources’ Gruyere deposit could yield up to $100 million per annum for the mid-tier developer once it reaches production.

Mr Osborne told the Denver Gold Forum in Colorado Springs last week Gold Road expected the joint venture with prominent South African miner Gold Fields to enter production in the first quarter of 2019.

Mr Osborne, Gold Road’s exploration and growth executive director, said early forecasts expected the company to receive up to $100 million as part of its stake in the project.

The comments came in the wake of Gold Road reporting a 40m at 2.5g per tonne intersection from 417m at Gruyere, 200km east of Laverton.

Mr Osborne said Gold Road was buoyed by the estimates, which could fund future exploration campaigns along the Yamarna Belt. “We are on schedule now for first gold production in the first quarter of 2019,” he said. “Once that goes into production, we are forecasting to achieve somewhere between $A80 million to $A100 millioner annum from our share of the project.

“What are we going to do with that money?

“We want to but it into exploration and building projects Yamarna — exploration is our life blood.”

Gold Road is developing Gruyere in a 50-50 joint venture with Gold Fields, with the mine’s development expected to cost $532 million and operate for up to 13 years.

About 300 full-time jobs will be delivered once the mine is operational.

Also speaking at this year’s forum in the US, Gold Fields chief executive Nick Holland said the joint venture offered exciting prospects for both parties, comparing it to Evolution Mining’s Cowal gold mine.

“I think we are going to do pretty good here and I think it’s going to be a great investment,” he said.

“It looks and feels a lot like Lake Cowal, which is obviously in New South Wales ... similar grade, very good distribution of the ore body across the entire strike length.”

EXX - Results of the MS333 election process and renewal of cautionary announcement

EXXARO RESOURCES LIMITED
Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa

("Exxaro" or the "Company")

RESULTS OF THE MS333 ELECTION PROCESS AND RENEWAL OF CAUTIONARY
ANNOUNCEMENT

1.     UPDATE ON THE REPLACEMENT BEE TRANSACTION AND MS333 ELECTION PROCESS

1.1.   Exxaro shareholders are referred to the cautionary announcement released on the Stock Exchange
       News Service ("SENS") on Monday, 18 September 2017, relating to the terms of the replacement
       black economic empowerment transaction (the "Replacement BEE Transaction") (the "Terms
       Announcement").

1.2.   Exxaro wishes to inform shareholders that the process undertaken by Main Street Proprietary
       Limited ("MS333") to determine the number of Exxaro shares ("Exxaro Shares") to be reinvested
       into the Replacement BEE Transaction structure (the "New Empowerment Structure") (the
       "MS333 Election Process") has now been concluded.

1.3.   Certain MS333 shareholders, excluding the Industrial Development Corporation (the "IDC") (the
       "Reinvesting MS333 Shareholders") have irrevocably committed to reinvest 28 052 845 Exxaro
       shares into the New Empowerment Structure (the "MS333 Reinvestment"). The balance of the
       Exxaro Shares held by MS333, excluding the Exxaro Shares to be utilised by the IDC for
       reinvestment into the New Empowerment Structure (the "IDC Reinvestment"), will be distributed
       by MS333 to its shareholders in the form of cash and/or Exxaro Shares not subject to the New
       Empowerment Structure restrictions, as elected in the MS333 Election Process and subject to the
       cash proceeds realised in the market by MS333 through a placement of Exxaro Shares.

1.4.   The Reinvesting MS333 Shareholders' interests in the New Empowerment Structure will be held
       through a separately incorporated special purpose vehicle ("BEE SPV"). This will result in the
       equity of the special purpose vehicle established for purposes of being the empowerment vehicle
       that will hold Exxaro Shares ("NewBEECo") to be held in the following proportions:

        NewBEECo shareholder                              Percentage equity interest
        BEE SPV                                           52.2%
        Exxaro                                            24.9%
        IDC                                               22.9%
        Total                                             100.0%

1.5.   The result of the MS333 Reinvestment, as set out in this announcement, is that NewBEECo's
       shareholding will be more than 51.0% held for the benefit of Historically Disadvantaged South
       African ("HDSA") shareholders, through BEE SPV. The HDSA status of the New Empowerment
       Structure is subject to final verification to the satisfaction of Exxaro. Shareholders are referred to
       the conditions precedent to the Replacement BEE Transaction, as contained in the Terms
       Announcement.

1.6.   Further details of the New Empowerment Structure and the Reinvesting MS333 Shareholders will
       be included in the circular to Exxaro shareholders.

1.7.   Exxaro will release a further announcement on SENS, showing the pro forma financial effects of
       the Replacement BEE Transaction as well as setting out the revised timeline for implementation of
       the Replacement BEE Transaction

2.     RENEWAL OF CAUTIONARY

       Further to the renewal of cautionary announcement issued on 18 September 2017, given that the
       pro forma financial effects of the Replacement BEE Transaction are still being finalised, Exxaro
       shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in Exxaro shares, until
       these effects are announced.

The net proceeds of the Placing will be utilised by MS333 to: (i) generate cash for MS333
shareholders who need to settle their funding obligations following the MS333 Unwind; (ii)
generate the cash consideration due to MS333 shareholders who have elected (or are deemed

(iii) defray any fees, costs, expenses and/or Taxes of and relating to the Placing and the MS333
Unwind.

The price per Placing Share (the "Placing Price") will be determined through the Bookbuild,
which process will open with immediate effect following this announcement. The timing of
closing of the Bookbuild, pricing and allocations areat the absolute discretion of MS333.

Details of the final number of Placing Shares and the Placing Price will be announced on SENS

Zuma’s man Bosses say they want Mosebenzi Zwane to be replaced

“The president has appointed a crook and a joker”

SIPHO PITYANAAngloGold Ashanti chairman

Mining industry boycotts minister

South Africa’s mining bosses are pushing for a new mineral resources minister, boycotting a keynote address by incumbent Mosebenzi Zwane during which he raised eyebrows by saying the outcome of the ANC’s national elective conference was a foregone conclusion.

While Zwane was playing politics at a mining industry’s Joburg Indaba gala dinner on Tuesday, delegates from companies like Anglo American‚ Harmony Gold‚ Sibanye Gold‚ PWC and JP Morgan‚ KPMG and Standard Bank were outspoken about him in an online poll conducted on Wednesday morning.

Asked about “the one thing you want the ANC-led government to do for mining”, 41% called for a new minister.

Another 26.6% called for the scrapping of the controversial Mining Charter that happened on Zwane’s watch.

Disagreement over the charter is one of the main reasons why the Chamber of Mines boycotted the dinner where Zwane was the guest speaker.

Zwane, widely seen as an ally of President Jacob Zuma, spoke about the ANC’s upcoming national elective conference in December.

“We already know who will be president … It’s a done deal. We are not stressing. The policies won’t change. In January there will be new leadership and policies will remain the same‚” said Zwane.

The matter had already been decided at branch level around the country and the result was already known within the party, he added.

Political analyst Ebrahim Fakir said no one could know the outcome of the election yet.

“Maybe it is bluster or he knows something we don’t know. Maybe he is party to manipulating the voting process‚” Fakir said.

Chamber of Mines CEO Roger Baxter said there was a conscious decision not to attend the event with Zwane. “It was not an impetuous decision,” Baxter told journalists.

“Not only has Minister Zwane published a charter whose full implementation would destroy the industry, he also recklessly sought to introduce a moratorium on approving new rights or amending rights. He did so on the basis of his refusal to engage on the issues.”

He said Zwane seemingly came into his role to “apparently force the sale of a mine to a well-known family that has systematically robbed SA of funds”, a reference to the Gupta family.

Sipho Pityana, outspoken chairman of AngloGold Ashanti, backed the Chamber of Mines.

“The president has appointed a crook and a joker. Zwane is not committed to the industry. All he wants to do is loot, steal and undermine the industry. I fully endorse that the chamber stays away from that crook,” said Pityana.

The chamber has made it clear that it wants a renegotiated charter that all stakeholders can agree to.

In the revised charter the black ownership target was increased from 26% to 30% — a requirement mining companies will have to comply with within 12 months.

DA leader Mmusi Maimane called for a rewrite of the mining charter.

“Rip up the new Mining Charter,” he said.

Maimane also advised that “the biggest part of the mining pie should not be going to politically connected individuals. All that will do is to sign mining’s death warrant.” — Additional reporting by Allan Seccombe

Payment provider split leaves Oakbay in cold

Move triggers Gupta firm to step up fight to keep accounts open

By

THE desperation of the Oakbay group to keep its accounts at the Bank of Baroda open appears to have arisen from a decision by Oakbay’s third-party payment provider to cut all ties with the group, Business Day has learnt.

Other firms contracted to handle the service are not operational. Terbium Financial Services, which acted as Oakbay Resources and Energy’s transfer secretary on the JSE but resigned as state capture and money-laundering allegations swirled around the Gupta family, said it had severed ties with the group of companies.

Three others – Smart City Innovations, The White Lion and Option Rainbow Maritime – do not seem to be registered with the relevant bodies.

“When it became evident earlier this year of the sensitivities and conflicts of business interests in handling Oakbay as a client, Terbium immediately resigned the business, but we received legal advice that we would have to honour the contractual notice period which ended in August,” said Terbium chief executive Andre van der Zee.

Evidence included by Manoj Kumar Jha, the Bank of Baroda’s acting chief executive, in Oakbay’s bid to hang on to its bank accounts showed that Terbium, then known as Trifecta Capital, had entered into a minimum 12-month contract with Oakbay’s Ronica Ragavan on June 3 2016.

This was for the provision of payment agent services, with a 30-day notice period if Trifecta terminated the contract early.

Trifecta charged Oakbay a premium for the “reputational risk” that the company was taking by providing the services.

By July 14, two months after the signed contract was due to expire, Terbium was still servicing Oakbay, with court papers showing it requested Oakbay to transfer R5.7-million so that it could pay Oakbay’s employees and suppliers. Oakbay then instructed the Bank of Baroda to transfer the funds.

“Our relationship with Oakbay was in line with all financial and legal requirements,” said Van der Zee, who took nearly a week to respond to Business Day’s queries.

“To confirm, Terbium has severed all ties with Oakbay,” Van der Zee said.

Terbium holds a Category 1 licence granted by the Financial Services Board for the provision of intermediary services in the dealing of shares and deposits.

“There are no complaints against this company,” said Financial Services Board spokesman Nokuthula Mtungwa.

It emerged during court proceedings that Oakbay had signed contracts with Smart City Innovations, The White Lion and Option Rainbow Maritime in July.

None of the three companies are registered with either the Financial Services Board or the Payment Association of SA, which authorises or registers third-party payment providers who are not members of the Reserve Bank’s national payment system.

Smart City and The White Lion share a registered address at the same office park in Fourways in Johannesburg, according to Companies and Intellectual Property Commission records. Smart City was registered with the commission 10 days after it signed the contract with Oakbay.

Calls to Smart City’s sole director, Renier Liebenberg, went directly to voicemail, and he did not respond to messages left for him.

The White Lion’s Maritza Fruin received Business Day’s messages, but hung up when the reporter followed up with a call.

The Bank of Baroda was due to close Oakbay’s accounts at the end of September, fearing reputational damage from the Guptas’ alleged involvement in state capture.

It had succeeded in dismissing Oakbay’s high court application for an interim order to temporarily keep its accounts open until Oakbay could make its case against their permanent closure in the main application in December.

Oakbay had argued it needed the accounts to pay its employees and suppliers, a contention Jha said was without foundation because it used Terbium for these services.

Jha also said the bank, with its two branches and 16 employees, did not have the infrastructural capacity to pay Oakbay’s more than 7000 employees.

After the failure of its interim application, Oakbay applied to have the December application heard before the September 30 deadline for the closure of the accounts.

The high court’s Judge Tati Makgoka ordered the bank to keep the accounts open until his ruling by October 9. — BDLive

ZCI - ZCI LIMITED - Renewal of Cautionary Announcement

Renewal of Cautionary Announcement

ZCI Limited
(Bermudian registration number 661:1969)
JSE share code: ZCI
ISIN: BMG9887P1068
Euronext share code: BMG9887P1068
("ZCI" or the "Company")

RENEWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT

Shareholders are referred to the previous cautionary announcements released by ZCI in connection with the
liquidation of each of Messina Copper (Botswana) Proprietary Limited (in Liquidation) ("Messina" or "MCB")
and African Copper plc (in Liquidation) ("ACU"). Capitalised terms defined in previous announcements have
the same meaning when used herein.

Shareholders are reminded that the completion of the Transaction (including receipt by ZCI of the cash
distribution due to it in connection with the sale of the Messina assets) is dependent on certain suspensive
conditions being satisfied. The key remaining condition to be satisfied is a successful fundraising by Leboam
to satisfy, inter alia, the cash consideration due to MCB under the Transaction. Leboam is actively engaged
in raising the required funding.

Shareholders are advised that the long stop date for satisfaction of all suspensive conditions, including the
Leboam fundraising condition, has been extended to 14 November 2017. When the suspensive conditions
which relate only to the completion date for transfer of the Messina assets are satisfied, title in the Messina
assets will vest in Leboam, and simultaneously with the transfer of title, Leboam will issue to ZCI the same
security over the Messina assets that ZCI currently has.

Due to the nature of the suspensive conditions to the Transaction and the uncertainty in respect of the
successful funding of the purchase price of the Transaction, as at the date of this announcement the board
of directors of ZCI cannot reliably estimate the extent of any potential proceeds arising as a result of the
aforementioned liquidation proceedings.

The Company will provide updates to stakeholders as and when further information in relation to the above
matters, including the full financial impact thereof, has been made available.

As a result of the events explained above, the board of directors of ZCI is not able to provide a date on which
the suspension of trading, in securities of ZCI, is expected to be lifted as is required in terms of Section
1.10(c) of the JSE Limited Listings Requirements.

New Age Metals finds high-grade PGMs at River Valley

The optics are rarely very good when a major pulls out of a joint-venture project with a junior company.

In the case of River Valley in northwestern Ontario, now the largest undeveloped primary platinum group metals (PGM) project in Canada with 2.5 million oz. of near-surface PGMs and gold, Anglo Platinum (JSE: AMS) spent US$30 million earning a 50% stake before turning off the taps after the financial crisis struck in 2008.

Anglo Platinum was hunting globally for Bushveld-type igneous complexes and River Valley was the first one it looked at outside of South Africa. The company’s search radius went on to encompass Australia, Brazil, China and Russia.

“They were spending a lot of money because they needed to expand outside of South Africa,” explains Trevor Richardson, president and chief operating officer of New Age Metals (TSXV: NAM; US-OTC: PAWEF), which now owns 100% of the project.

What happened next, Richardson says, was beyond anyone’s control. The platinum price tanked and the South African Rand came on par with the U.S. Dollar. Suddenly, Anglo Platinum was cutting its exploration budgets around the world and at home.

“They had joint ventures in Russia, China, South America, and they pulled out of everywhere,” Richardson says. “So they didn’t pull out from River Valley for technical reasons. They pulled out for budget reasons.”

New Age Metals – which changed its name from Pacific Northwest Capital in January – eventually recovered full control of the project in January 2011, buying it back from Anglo Platinum in shares, and has been advancing River Valley on its own ever since.

While Anglo Platinum retreated from River Valley, however, the project remained of interest to two key executives at the South African mining company who had worked on the asset between 1999 and 2008, and now sit on New Age Metals’ board of directors and its advisory board.

Ron Hieber, who moved from the junior’s advisory board to its board of directors in June, was in charge of Anglo Platinum’s PGM exploration programs worldwide, and had spent many years heading up the River Valley joint venture.

His colleague, Gordon Chunnet, who is now on New Age Metals’ advisory board, spent 31 years as head of platinum geology and exploration for Anglo Platinum and is also quite familiar with the project.

“Ron and Gordon were the heads of Anglo Platinum on the technical side for 30 years at least and were instrumental in where the company’s budget was spent,” Richardson says on a mid-September tour of the River Valley project, about 100 km east of Sudbury. “They wouldn’t have come back and got involved if they didn’t believe in this project.”

Hieber says that when he originally worked on the project for Anglo Platinum, River Valley “presented potential in several ways.” Despite lower grades than what he was used to with the Bushveld ores, he says, the River Valley deposits occurred on surface and were wide enough to be mined as an open pit.

“Unlike the Bushveld ores, which are oxidized to around 30 metres depth, River Valley mineralization is fresh and therefore amenable to good recoveries right at the start of mining,” he writes in an email from his home in South Africa. “What was missing was a critical mass of mineral resource that could generate an economic return.”

Anglo Platinum’s studies showed that River Valley could be mined profitably on a working cost basis, he says, but it didn’t have enough ore to pay back the capital expenditure. That problem, however, has the potential to be resolved, Hieber believes, because the company now has “expanded targets” that “can significantly increase the resource and hence ore reserves, while still supporting open-pit mining.”

The expanded targets Hieber refers to include a new higher grade area to the north of the main deposit that the company found in 2015 and is calling the Pine Zone, potential new targets further to the north of River Valley’s main zone, as well as targets on land it acquired to the south of the main zone in July 2016 from Mustang Minerals Corp. (TSXV: MUM).

With the addition of Mustang’s ground, known as the River Valley Extension, New Age Metal’s land in the area has grown to 64 sq. km, and River Valley's strike length has increased from 12 km to 16 km. The deposit remains open at depth.

The company confirmed the Pine Zone discovery in December 2016, reporting assay results of 2.57 grams per tonne palladium and platinum over 18 metres from 169 metres downhole in hole T2-06; 1.92 grams palladium and platinum over 20 metres starting from 202 metres in hole T2-10; and 1.84 grams palladium and platinum over 17 metres from 217 metres in hole T2-11.

Earlier holes at Pine Zone returned intercepts of 9 metres grading 3.909 grams palladium and platinum starting from 145 metres in hole DN002 and 16 metres of 2.05 grams palladium and platinum from 184 metres downhole in DN001.

The Pine Zone is about 140 metres from the main resource zone of the deposit and its discovery, New Age Metals says, is a testament to the success the company has had finding near-surface mineralized zones based on IP geophysical surveys and 3D geological modelling. It also underscored “the potential for discovery of similar mineralized zones in other previously overlooked areas at River Valley,” and was “an additional indication of the camp-scale potential in the under-explored region east of Sudbury.”

Since then, New Age Metals has confirmed that PGM mineralization in the Pine Zone extends to at least 300 metres below surface.

“The Pine Zone generally tends to return higher grades than the original zones that we were drilling throughout most of the exploration program,” Richard Zemoroz, the company’s project geologist, says. “It will increase our tonnage, probably add higher grade, and because it will extend the width of the intrusive at that point, or the mineralized zone, it will probably give us a more favorable stripping ratio.”

As for the River Valley Extension property, Zemoroz describes it as “under-explored.” “Mustang had it for a while and they have done some drilling and some geophysics,” he says, “but there are a lot of places that require more work before we do any drilling there.”

Surface grab samples from the River Valley Extension have returned assay values of up to 10 grams per tonne PGM, and limited drilling has returned intercepts of 1.4 grams per tonne PGM over 9 metres; 4 grams PGM over 2.1 metres; and 2.2 grams PGM over 4.5 metres.

The company’s current exploration focus is finding higher grade, near-surface mineralization in the northern part of the deposit.

In June, the company completed an induced polarization (IP) geophysical survey of the Pine Zone, which remains open along strike and at depth, and extended the IP survey to include the Banshee Zone, about 2 km to the southeast along the trend of the River Valley main zone. (In 2003, 25 holes were drilled into Banshee and surface exploration and geophysics outlined a zone of over 600 metres.)

The surface IP over the Pine Zone tested the potential for eastwards and southwards extensions, as well as the adjacent Dana North Zone. The company says there is about 2 km of untested potential for additional mineralization along the trend between the drilled extent of the Pine Zone and the under-explored Pardo Zone to the northwest.

In mid-July, New Age Metals kicked off a 5,000-metre drill program. The program will focus on follow-up drilling to further test the continuation of the Pine Zone and the Dana North Zone. The drilling is mainly exploratory and intended to test the footwall mineralization in the northern part of the property.

Late last month, the company reported drill holes from the Dana North zone. The best result was an intercept of 2.45 grams per tonne palladium, platinum and gold over 28 metres, including 7.12 grams palladium, platinum and gold over 3 metres.

“If you’re talking about the Bushveld, they’re mining widths of over one or two metres and they’re like eight grams per tonne, so that 7.12 grams over 3 metres is a really good intercept – that’s a world-class intercept,” Zemoroz says.

“We’re so excited about those results,” says Richardson. “Those are really big thicknesses, which makes it easier to mine open cast.”

River Valley, about halfway between North Bay and Sudbury, one of the largest nickel-copper-PGM sulphide mining and metallurgical centres in the world, contains 3.9 million ounces of palladium-equivalent in the measured and indicated category and another 1.2 million ounces of palladium-equivalent inferred.

The latest resource estimate, from May 2012, identified measured and indicated resources of 91.34 million tonnes grading 0.58 gram per tonne palladium, 0.22 gram per tonne platinum, and 0.04 gram gold, at a cut-off grade of 0.8 gram per tonne palladium equivalent. Inferred resources add 35.91 million tonnes grading 0.36 gram palladium, 0.14 gram platinum, and 0.03 gram gold.

The company plans to start updating the resource this fall, with drilling it has completed since 2012, and says it will embark on a preliminary economic assessment next year.

The River Valley intrusive covers 200 km within the Grenville Front tectonic zone, a 900-metre thick, mafic, sulphide-poor layered intrusion. The project’s mineralized areas all contain PGMs, gold and small amounts of copper and nickel that could count as credits at any future mine.

Metallurgical work by SGS in 2013 produced bulk sample grades of 16% copper, 2% nickel, and 189 grams per tonne PGM, and metal recoveries of 84% copper, 22% nickel, and 69% PGMs. Because it has no deleterious metals, a sulphide concentrator could effectively process material from River Valley.

The company is weighing processing options that include dense media separation to remove the sulphides. The PEA will assess various processing options.

Hieber notes that there have been advances in processing PGM ores at lower capital costs than is typical, “and if these methods work on River Valley, which is not yet known, the economics look better.”

Only about 10 million ounces of palladium are produced in any given year and most of it comes from Russia and South Africa. Richardson forecasts total demand this year will surpass 10 million ounces for the second year in a row and points to a dearth of palladium-rich projects that can fill the gap.

“There’s going to be a deficit because the mines in South Africa have become much deeper and more expensive to mine. There’s nothing new coming on line – we went through that lag period, when no one was doing exploration.”

“Several South African deposits have reached their sell-by dates (and some have been sold) and although PGM markets have lost a lot of luster, in time, the loss of South African production will express itself in improved prices,” Hieber says. “All of this suggests that there is a lot to look forward to with River Valley, where there is an experienced team in place from the president down.”

In addition to its aging mines, South Africa is not seen as a particularly appetizing jurisdiction in which to operate, Richardson argues, which could lead to more mining companies moving outside the country in search of new assets.

As proof he points to Johannesburg-listed Sibanye Gold’s US$2.2 billion acquisition in May of Stillwater Mining, the only U.S. miner of PGMs and the largest primary producer of the precious metals outside of South Africa and Russia.

“What you’re going to start seeing is those South African companies diversifying their risk and coming back to North America,” he says. “Sibanye buying Stillwater was proof — that was the first one — and I think you’ll start seeing the others begin saying if Sibanye can do that, we can too.”

“Not a lot of people know PGMs and there is only one mine in Canada,” Richardson adds, referring to North American Palladium’s (TSX: PDL; US-OTC: PALDF) Lac des Iles mine, 90 km northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario. That mine has been in production for over 20 years, and North American Palladium is the only pure play palladium producer in the world.

“If you asked anyone to name ten gold projects they could probably do it,” Richardson says, “but ask them to name ten palladium projects and I bet they couldn’t. I couldn’t!”

Richardson, a geologist, also notes that North American Palladium started off “with a similar type of scenario” to River Valley, “and then when they went underground, they started getting much better grade.”

“Now we have the opportunity to drill deeper holes, and we may or may not find the same thing. They are very similar type deposits.”

New Age Metals’ vision is that River Valley will become an open-pit mine one day, with a concentrator on site. The concentrate would then be sent to a smelter in Sudbury, where concentrates from North American Palladium’s Lac des Iles are also sent.

Jon Hykawy, president of Stormcrow Capital, says he’s impressed with New Age Metals’ team — “not just in terms of the management group but the wider group of consultants” — and says he’s seen very few projects with better infrastructure.

“I guess it’s going to come down to how well the metallurgy works and what the appetite is out in the market for a PGM project,” he says.

While the price of palladium has been rising for nearly three years in a row and currently sits at about US$930 per oz., many investors believe the move towards electric vehicles means that the longer term prospects look dim for platinum and palladium. The two metals are used in catalytic converters in gasoline-powered and diesel-powered vehicles to clean up exhaust.

But Hykawy, who has a PhD in physics, doesn’t agree. “I think a lot of people have decided the market has spoken and the solution is a battery powered car and to my mind that’s facile and silly,” he says. “The issue with batteries is they’re great at power generation but lousy at storing energy.”

“If you look at a Tesla,” he says, “you realize very quickly that not only is it an expensive vehicle, but for all of Tesla’s attempts to sugar-coat it, the car requires adaptation from the owner.”

If you are used to the idea that you can jump in your car in Montreal and drive to Toronto and when you’re ready to turn around and drive back to Montreal, you can do so whenever you like, then electric vehicles could be problematic, Hykawy says.

“Today you can probably do that drive from Montreal to Toronto and back because you’ll probably find an electric charging station, but in future, when all those charging stations are occupied, you may have a very difficult time finding a place to charge that’s convenient for you and that is also available and has a spot open to you when you want it,” he says.

“They are already seeing that impact in parts of Europe and China and this begs the question: ‘Should there be some charging system on board and what sort of charging system should it be?”

For his part, Harry Barr, New Age Metals’ founder, chairman and CEO, who has spent more than thirty years cutting deals and raising money in the mining industry, is a true believer in River Valley.

“In 2000 we had a little 5¢ stock that went to almost $5 on the strength of a brand new discovery called River Valley, and we started the largest staking rush in the history of the Sudbury mining district,” he says.

“Management has about $3 million in this personally, and a lot of that is my money, so this has become a personal thing to me and I do want it to work.”

Of the company’s roughly 2,000 shareholders, 10.08% are management and insiders, 10.23% is owned by merchant bank Palisade Global Investments, and 1.32% by Kaymin Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo Platinum.

The junior has 68.5 million shares common shares outstanding and it has been trading within a 52-week range of 5¢ and 15¢ per share. At press time its shares were trading at 6¢ apiece.

              Withdrawal of Fund-Raising Resolution at the forthcoming General Meeting

FCR, the lead-zinc exploration company, announces that, following the resignation of the
Company's Executive Chairman on 26 September 2017, the Board of FCR is in the process of
comprehensive operational review, focused on how best to derive value for FCR shareholders from
the Toral lead-zinc asset.

From initial work completed, the Board believes that it is possible its pursue a strategy to build
value at the Toral lead zinc asset for a cost lower than originally planned and, therefore, the full
A$2.7 million which the Board originally envisaged would be required to be raised in a placing, may
not be required. The results of the operational review will be announced in due course.

In light of these developments, the Board has decided that, at the general meeting convened for
18 October 2017 (the "General Meeting"), Resolution 1, seeking shareholder approval to raise up
to A$2.7 million by way of private placement, will be withdrawn.

On 15 September 2017, the Notice of General Meeting was lodged with the ASX and subsequently
dispatched to shareholders of FCR, to be held at 11.00 a.m. (Perth time) on Wednesday, 18 October
2017 at The Hovia Room, Metro Hotel Perth, 61 Canning Highway, South Perth, Western Australia
6151.

The withdrawal of Resolution 1 will not affect the validity of the proxy form attached to the Notice
of General Meeting or any proxy votes already submitted in respect of the remaining Resolution to
be put to shareholders for approval. Shareholders wishing to complete and lodge a proxy form at
the General Meeting do not need to indicate their voting instructions on Resolution 1.

New Age Metals finds high-grade PGMs at River Valley

The optics are rarely very good when a major pulls out of a joint-venture project with a junior company.

In the case of River Valley in northwestern Ontario, now the largest undeveloped primary platinum group metals project in Canada with 2.5 million oz. of near-surface PGMs and gold, Anglo Platinum (JSE: AMS) spent US$30 million earning a 50% stake before turning off the taps after the financial crisis struck in 2008.

Anglo Platinum was hunting globally for Bushveld-type igneous complexes and River Valley was the first one it looked at outside of South Africa. The company’s search radius went on to encompass Australia, Brazil, China and Russia.

“They were spending a lot of money because they needed to expand outside of South Africa,” explains Trevor Richardson, president and chief operating officer of New Age Metals (TSXV: NAM; US-OTC: PAWEF), which now owns 100% of the project.

What happened next, Richardson says, was beyond anyone’s control. The platinum price tanked and the South African rand came on par with the U.S. dollar. Suddenly, Anglo Platinum was cutting its exploration budgets around the world and at home

“They had joint ventures in Russia, China, South America, and they pulled out of everywhere,” Richardson says. “So they didn’t pull out from River Valley for technical reasons, they pulled out for budget reasons.”

New Age Metals – which changed its name from Pacific Northwest Capital in January – eventually recovered full control of the project in January 2011, buying it back from Anglo Platinum in shares, and has been advancing River Valley on its own ever since.

While Anglo Platinum retreated from River Valley, however, the project remained of interest to two key executives at the South African mining company who had worked on the asset between 1999 and 2008, and now sit on New Age Metals’ board of directors and its advisory board.

Ron Hieber, who moved from the junior’s advisory board to its board of directors in June, was in charge of Anglo Platinum’s PGM exploration programs worldwide, and had spent many years heading up the River Valley joint venture.

His colleague, Gordon Chunnet, who is now on New Age Metals’ advisory board, spent 31 years as head of platinum geology and exploration for Anglo Platinum and is also quite familiar with the project.

“Ron and Gordon were the heads of Anglo Platinum on the technical side for thirty years at least and were instrumental in where the company’s budget was spent,” Richardson says on a mid-September tour of the River Valley project, about 100 km east of Sudbury. “They wouldn’t have come back and got involved if they didn’t believe in this project.”

Hieber says that when he originally worked on the project for Anglo Platinum, River Valley “presented potential in several ways.” Despite lower grades than what he was used to with the Bushveld ores, he says, the River Valley deposits occurred on surface and were wide enough to be mined as an open pit.

“Unlike the Bushveld ores, which are oxidized to around 30 metres depth, River Valley mineralization is fresh and therefore amenable to good recoveries right at the start of mining,” he writes in an email from his home in South Africa. “What was missing was a critical mass of mineral resource that could generate an economic return.”

Anglo Platinum’s studies showed that River Valley could be mined profitably on a working cost basis, he says, but it didn’t have enough ore to pay back the capital expenditure. That problem, however, has the potential to be resolved, Hieber believes, because the company now has “expanded targets” that “can significantly increase the resource and hence ore reserves, while still supporting open-pit mining.”

The expanded targets Hieber refers to include a new higher grade area to the north of the main deposit that the company found in 2015 and is calling the Pine Zone, potential new targets further to the north of River Valley’s main zone, as well as targets on land it acquired to the south of the main zone in July 2016 from Mustang Minerals Corp. (TSXV: MUM).

With the addition of Mustang’s ground, known as the River Valley Extension, New Age Metal’s land in the area has grown to 64 square kilometres and River Valley's strike length has increased from 12 km to 16 km. The deposit remains open at depth.

The company confirmed the Pine Zone discovery in December 2016, reporting assay results of 2.57 grams per tonne palladium and platinum over 18 metres from 169 metres downhole in hole T2-06; 1.92 grams palladium and platinum over 20 metres starting from 202 metres in hole T2-10; and 1.84 grams palladium and platinum over 17 metres from 217 metres in hole T2-11.

Earlier holes at Pine Zone returned intercepts of 9 metres grading 3.909 grams palladium and platinum starting from 145 metres in hole DN002 and 16 metres of 2.05 grams palladium and platinum from 184 metres downhole in DN001.

The Pine Zone is about 140 metres from the main resource zone of the deposit and its discovery, New Age Metals says, is a testament to the success the company has had finding near-surface mineralized zones based on IP geophysical surveys and 3D geological modelling. It also underscored “the potential for discovery of similar mineralized zones in other previously overlooked areas at River Valley,” and was “an additional indication of the camp-scale potential in the under-explored region east of Sudbury.”

Since then, New Age Metals has confirmed that PGM mineralization in the Pine Zone extends to at least 300 metres below surface.

“The Pine Zone generally tends to return higher grades than the original zones that we were drilling throughout most of the exploration program,” Richard Zemoroz, the company’s project geologist, says. “It will increase our tonnage, probably add higher grade, and because it will extend the width of the intrusive at that point, or the mineralized zone, it will probably give us a more favorable stripping ratio.”

As for the River Valley Extension property, Zemoroz describes it as “under-explored.” “Mustang had it for a while and they have done some drilling and some geophysics,” he says, “but there are a lot of places that require more work before we do any drilling there.”

Surface grab samples from the River Valley Extension have returned assay values of up to 10 grams per tonne PGM, and limited drilling has returned intercepts of 1.4 grams per tonne PGM over 9 metres; 4 grams PGM over 2.1 metres; and 2.2 grams PGM over 4.5 metres.

The company’s current exploration focus is finding higher grade, near-surface mineralization in the northern part of the deposit.

In June, the company completed an induced polarization (IP) geophysical survey of the Pine Zone, which remains open along strike and at depth, and extended the IP survey to include the Banshee Zone, about 2 km to the southeast along the trend of the River Valley main zone. (In 2003, 25 holes were drilled into Banshee and surface exploration and geophysics outlined a zone of over 600 metres.)

The surface IP over the Pine Zone tested the potential for eastwards and southwards extensions, as well as the adjacent Dana North Zone. The company says there is about 2 km of untested potential for additional mineralization along the trend between the drilled extent of the Pine Zone and the underexplored Pardo Zone to the northwest.

In mid-July, New Age Metals kicked off a 5,000-metre drill program. The program will focus on follow-up drilling to further test the continuation of the Pine Zone and the Dana North Zone. The drilling is mainly exploratory and intended to test the footwall mineralization in the northern part of the property.

Late last month, the company reported drill holes from the Dana North zone. The best result was an intercept of 2.45 grams per tonne palladium, platinum and gold over 28 metres, including 7.12 grams palladium, platinum and gold over 3 metres.

“If you’re talking about the Bushveld, they’re mining widths of over one or two metres and they’re like eight grams per tonne, so that 7.12 grams over 3 metres is a really good intercept – that’s a world-class intercept,” Zemoroz says.

“We’re so excited about those results,” says Richardson. “Those are really big thicknesses, which makes it easier to mine open cast.”

River Valley, about halfway between North Bay and Sudbury, one of the largest nickel-copper-PGM sulphide mining and metallurgical centres in the world, contains 3.9 million ounces of palladium-equivalent in the measured and indicated category and another 1.2 million ounces of palladium-equivalent of inferred.

The latest resource estimate from May 2012, identified measured and indicated resources of 91.34 million tonnes grading 0.58 gram per tonne palladium, 0.22 gram per tonne platinum, and 0.04 gram gold, at a cut-off grade of 0.8 gram per tonne palladium equivalent. Inferred resources add 35.91 million tonnes grading 0.36 gram palladium; 0.14 gram platinum, and 0.03 gram gold.

The company plans to start updating the resource this fall, with drilling it has completed since 2012, and says it will embark on a preliminary economic assessment next year.

The River Valley intrusive covers 200 km within the Grenville Front tectonic zone, a 900-metre thick, mafic, sulphide-poor layered intrusion. The project’s mineralized areas all contain PGMs, gold and small amounts of copper and nickel that could count as credits at any future mine.

Metallurgical work by SGS in 2013 produced bulk sample grades of 16% copper, 2% nickel, and 189 grams per tonne PGM, and metal recoveries of 84% copper, 22% nickel, 69% PGMs. Because it has no deleterious metals, a sulphide concentrator could effectively process material from River Valley.

The company is weighing processing options that include dense media separation to remove the sulphides. The PEA will assess various processing options.

Hieber notes that there have been advances in processing PGM ores at lower capital costs than is typical, “and if these methods work on River Valley, which is not yet known, the economics look better.”

Only about 10 million ounces of palladium are produced in any given year and most of it comes from Russia and South Africa. Richardson forecasts total demand this year will surpass 10 million ounces for the second year in a row and points to a dearth of palladium-rich projects that can fill the gap.

“There’s going to be a deficit because the mines in South Africa have become much deeper and more expensive to mine. There’s nothing new coming on line – we went through that lag period when no one was doing exploration.”

“Several South African deposits have reached their sell-by dates (and some have been sold) and although PGM markets have lost a lot of luster, in time, the loss of South African production will express itself in improved prices,” Hieber says. “All of this suggests that there is a lot to look forward to with River Valley, where there is an experienced team in place from the president down.”

In addition to its aging mines, South Africa is not seen as a particularly appetizing jurisdiction in which to operate, Richardson argues, which could lead to more mining companies moving outside the country in search of new assets.

As proof he points to Johannesburg-listed Sibanye Gold’s US$2.2 billion acquisition in May of Stillwater Mining, the only U.S. miner of PGMs and the largest primary producer of the precious metals outside of South Africa and Russia.

“What you’re going to start seeing is those South African companies diversifying their risk and coming back to North America,” he says. “Sibanye buying Stillwater was proof – that was the first one – and I think you’ll start seeing the others begin saying if Sibanye can do that, we can too.”

“Not a lot of people know PGMs and there is only one mine in Canada,” Richardson adds, referring to North American Palladium’s (TSX: PDL; US-OTC: PALDF) Lac des Iles mine, 90 km northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario. That mine has been in production for over 20 years and North American Palladium is the only pure play palladium producer in the world.

“If you asked anyone to name ten gold projects they could probably do it,” Richardson says, “but ask them to name ten palladium projects and I bet they couldn’t. I couldn’t!”

Richardson, a geologist, also notes that North American Palladium started off “with a similar type of scenario” as River Valley did, “and then when they went underground, they started getting much better grade.”

“Now we have the opportunity to drill deeper holes, and we may or may not find the same thing. They are very similar type deposits.”

New Age Metals’ vision is that River Valley will become an open-pit mine one day with a concentrator on site. The concentrate would then be sent to a smelter in Sudbury, where concentrates from North American Palladium’s Lac des Iles are also sent.

Jon Hykawy, president of Stormcrow Capital, says he’s impressed with New Age Metals’ team – “not just in terms of the management group but the wider group of consultants” – and says he’s seen very few projects with better infrastructure.

“I guess it’s going to come down to how well the metallurgy works and what the appetite is out in the market for a PGM project,” he says.

While the price of palladium has been rising for nearly three years in a row and currently sits at about US$930 per oz., many investors believe the move towards electric vehicles means that the longer term prospects look dim for platinum and palladium. The two metals are used in catalytic converters in gasoline-powered and diesel-powered vehicles to clean up exhaust.

But Hykawy, who has a PhD in physics, doesn’t agree. “I think a lot of people have decided the market has spoken and the solution is a battery powered car and to my mind that’s facile and silly,” he says. “The issue with batteries is they’re great at power generation but lousy at storing energy.”

“If you look at a Tesla,” he says, “you realize very quickly that not only is it an expensive vehicle, but for all of Tesla’s attempts to sugar-coat it, the car requires adaptation from the owner.”

If you are used to the idea that you can jump in your car in Montreal and drive to Toronto and when you’re ready to turn around and drive back to Montreal, you can do so whenever you like, then electric vehicles could be problematic, Hykawy says.

“Today you can probably do that drive from Montreal to Toronto and back because you’ll probably find an electric charging station, but in future, when all those charging stations are occupied, you may have a very difficult time finding a place to charge that’s convenient for you and that is also available and has a spot open to you when you want it,” he says.

“They are already seeing that impact in parts of Europe and China and this begs the question: ‘Should there be some charging system on board and what sort of charging system should it be?”

For his part, Harry Barr, New Age Metals’ founder, chairman and CEO, who has spent more than thirty years cutting deals and raising money in the mining industry, is a true believer in River Valley.

“In 2000 we had a little five cent stock that went to almost $5 on the strength of a brand new discovery called River Valley and we started the largest staking rush in the history of the Sudbury mining district,” he says.

“Management has about $3 million in this personally and a lot of that is my money so this has become a personal thing to me and I do want it to work.”

Of the company’s roughly 2,000 shareholders, 10.08% are management and insiders, 10.23% is owned by merchant bank Palisade Global Investments, and 1.32% by Kaymin Resourcs, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo Platinum.

The junior has 68.5 million shares common shares outstanding and it has been trading within a 52-week range of $0.05 and $0.15 per share. At presstime its shares were trading at $0.06 apiece.

Cash fraction applicable to the capitalisation issue


Westonaria, 5 October 2017: Shareholders are referred to the Group´s
operating and financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2017,
which was published on the Stock Exchange News Service on 30 August 2017
in which a capitalisation issue was declared by the Sibanye-Stillwater
board.

The applicable ratio for the capitalisation issue was 2 capitalisation
issue shares for every 100 ordinary Sibanye-Stillwater shares held on the
Record Date, being Friday, 6 October 2017.

As per the above release, if the application of this ratio gave rise to a
fraction of an ordinary Sibanye-Stillwater share, such fraction would be
rounded down to the nearest whole number, resulting in whole ordinary
Sibanye-Stillwater shares being allocated with an equivalent cash payment
in compensating for the fraction ("Rounding Provision").

In accordance with the JSE Limited listing requirements, the cash payment
has been determined with reference to the volume weighted average price
of an ordinary Sibanye-Stillwater share traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 4
October 2017 (being the day on which an ordinary Sibanye-Stillwater share
began trading `ex´ the entitlement to receive the capitalisation issue),
discounted by 10%.

Shareholders are accordingly advised that the applicable cash payment for
the fractional entitlement is 1415 cents (1572 cents, discounted by 10%).

Example of fractional entitlement:

This example assumes that a Shareholder holds 125 ordinary shares at the
close of business on the Record Date.

New ordinary share entitlement = 125 x (2/100) = 2.5

The Rounding Provision described above is then applied and the shareholder
will receive:

2 Capitalisation issue shares in respect of the 100 ordinary shares held
and a cash payment for the fractional entitlement of 0.5 x 1415 = 707.5
cents.

Financing Update

Central Rand Gold Limited
(Incorporated as a company with limited liability under the laws of Guernsey,
Company Number 45108)

Financing Update


Due to the reasons described in the Company's announcements dated 23 February 2017,
11 May 2017, 20 July 2017 and 13 September 2017, the Company's operations have been
seriously hampered and have not produced the financial outcomes which management had
hoped for and which the directors consider shareholders deserve. The ongoing overhead of
the Company's listing costs are significant and are now disproportionate when weighed
against the benefits that the listings on AIM and AltX bring to shareholders.

The Company has previously announced the seriousness of its financial position and this
remains the case. The Company has debt commitments to Redstone Capital Limited and the
Wang family, amounting to US$ 9.8 million in aggregate, which could be called at any time.
Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries have trade and other creditors amounting to a
further US$ 7.8 million in aggregate. Whilst Central Rand Gold South Africa Proprietary
Limited's operations have stabilised operationally, the financial and operational positions
remain fragile. There is a very thin working capital position at the operating company level
with a negative position within the Company, as mentioned above. The Company's
production for the period 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2017 was 2 320 Troy Ounces.

The Company's overall financial position is negative and the directors are now actively
exploring urgent financing options. In order to remain a listed, operational mining group, in
steady state and with a view to achieving medium-term profitability, the directors consider
that a cash injection of not less than US$ 20 million would be required. The directors
consider that this is very unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future or at all. Accordingly,
the directors are actively pursuing options which would involve retaining its listings but will
require the disposal of the Company's interests in its immediate subsidiary company, Central
Rand Gold (Netherlands Antilles) NV, unless it is able to secure sufficient alternative finance
at the required level in the very near future.

Shale Gas in South Africa - Game-Changer or Damp Squib?

Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, otherwise known as fracking, has in the past few decades made available the gas in previously 'tight' shale geologies. This has shaken up the energy sector worldwide by contributing to relatively low oil prices. Almost all the shale gas development has taken place in the US where production has increased from about 1 to nearly 16 trillion cubic feet (tcf) over the past 25 years.

There are indications that shale gas may be present in a semi-desert region of South Africa known as the Karoo. The core region alone has an area of 400 000 km². If a viable gas resource were to be developed in the Karoo, what impact would it have on the global shale gas market? And how would it affect the energy economy of South Africa?

A few preliminary studies have been done on the potential for shale gas in the country. These include a report on the technical readiness for a shale gas industry in South Africa, a strategic environmental assessment on shale gas development commissioned by the Department of Environment which I co-led, and a multi-author academic book on hydraulic fracturing in the Karoo.

The research, presented at a recent conference, has led to a clearer picture of both the potential, and the challenges facing shale gas extraction in South Africa. The purpose of the conference, organised by the Academy of Science of South Africa, was to map out a multidisciplinary research plan to fill the critical knowledge gaps.

How much, how little?

The studies to date suggest that it's increasingly unlikely that economically and technically viable gas will be found in the Karoo. First desktop estimates of gas-in-place at depth in the Karoo basin were hundreds of tcf.

More realistic guesses - which is what they remain, in the absence of new exploration and testing - put the upper limit for gas in the Central Karoo at about 20 tcf. This is a tiny resource by global standards. In terms of energy content, 20 tcf of gas is about forty times smaller than the known remaining coal reserves in South Africa. Conventional gas reserves offshore of Mozambique have been estimated at 75 tcf. On the other hand, the continental shelf gas field off Mossel Bay located on South Africa's garden route, exploited and now nearly depleted, was 1 tcf.

A viable gas find in South Africa, even if quite small, would potentially transform the national energy economy. But making a large investment in infrastructure, regulatory tools, monitoring bodies, and wellfield development for a resource which may not exist is financially, politically and environmentally risky.

Any decisions about how the country should proceed must therefore be based on solid research which is why efforts are under way to adopt a multidisciplinary research programme to fill in the key knowledge gaps. On top of this, good governance is a prerequisite if South Africa is to proceed to shale gas development.

South Africa's energy mix

South Africa's formal energy economy is dominated by coal. But that cannot continue, as the country's cheap, easily accessible coal reserves are nearing an end. Coal mining has also devastated important agricultural and water-yielding landscapes. Financial institutions are increasingly reluctant to fund new coal-burning power stations because of the impact carbon dioxide emissions are having on the global climate.

As a result, coal-burning power stations are likely, over time, to be replaced by wind and solar energy, or perhaps the more expensive nuclear option. But the degree to which the country's energy supply can be based on intermittent sources like wind and sunshine depends on the availability of an energy source that can be easily switched on or off to fill the temporary shortfalls between supply and demand - like gas-fired turbines.

South Africa has already decided to increase the fraction of gas in its energy mix. The only question is where to source it from. Are international imports or domestic sources, like offshore conventional gas or onshore unconventional gas, including shale gas and coal-bed methane better?

Next steps

The optimal approach would be to take the first exploratory steps cooperatively, and in the public-domain, rather than in a competitive, secretive and proprietary way. This would allow South Africa to learn about the deep geology of the Karoo and the technologies and hazards of deep drilling, even if no viable gas was found.

A "virtual wellfield", an imaginary but realistic computer simulation, could be developed on the basis of these findings. This would allow decision-makers and the public to better understand the economic spinoffs and environmental hazards of gas development before any significant actual development occurs.

The continuing low price of oil and the reduced demand for energy caused by the faltering South African economy buy the country time to do the necessary research and exploration. It can establish the appropriate regulatory environment and institutions before making rushed decisions with large potential consequences.

This is a cautious, evidence-guided agenda which should be acceptable to most people who care both about national development and the quality of the environment.

Exxaro sign agreement with Transnet on Waterberg to Richards Bay coal terminal

The 10-year agreement between Exxaro and Transnet will allow for the transportation of a total of 7.8 million t of export coal, of which 3 million t will come from the Waterberg once all the projects are ramped up, the two companies announced earlier today.

Commenting on the signing of the Agreement, Mxolisi Mgojo, Chief Executive Officer of Exxaro said: Exxaro is proud to be developing the Waterberg area in collaboration with Transnet. This is an exciting milestone for Exxaro and is a realisation of our vision to contributing to the unlocking of the Waterberg, thus creating jobs and powering economic development in South Africa. As such, we will be investing 50% of our R20bn coal capex programme over the next five years in coal in the Waterberg area.

Transnet has a proven track record in building rail capacity and expanding export rail performance in the Waterberg area and across South Africa. This Agreement is testament to healthy public-private partnerships. It will also enable Transnet to increase rail infrastructure capacity to service both domestic and export markets from the Waterberg area, Mgojo added.

The new contract will also see the collapse of the old agreement between Transnet and Exxaro Resource Limited.

This fresh agreement comes at the time when the Transnets Waterberg Programme is in full swing with plans to complete the second phase of the project in March 2019. The Waterberg upgrade phase two will grow export rail capacity to 6 million t through incremental upgrades of the existing rail networks and yards using additional loops, while maintaining the existing axle load, electrical upgrades and improved train control systems.

The agreement is a key contribution to the Waterberg expansion programme earmarked in the National Development Plan (NDP) as a strategic coal mining area and national asset to growing the South African economy.

Welcoming the signing of the agreement, Siyabonga Gama, Transnet Group CEO said: We are pleased with reaching a key milestone with Exxaro to improve rail infrastructure in the Waterberg area which includes the strengthening and expansion of the Waterberg Link (the Lephalale Line).We are a key enabler to growing the South African economy and are playing our role in developing more rail capacity and unlocking the capacity of the Waterberg region to domestic and export markets.

Exxaros signing of the long-term agreement with Transnet will enable the GG6 expansion of the Grootegeluk operation in the Waterberg area that requires rail capacity to Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

The signing of the contract comes on the foot of the completion of first phase in the Waterberg Expansion Programme in 2016 which included a 1.8 km passing loop which enables 100- wagons trains to cross without disrupting other rail operations on the line.

SA's Chamber of Mines at work developing 'new' Mining Charter; The mining industry says it is consulting with civil society organisations, unions and government leaders about the charter.

The president of the Chamber of Mines of South Africa, Mxolisi Mgojo, said on Thursday that the mining industry was hard at work developing ideas on how an alternative Mining Charter could look like.

This comes as the Chamber went to court in a bid to challenge the implementation of the 2017 Reviewed Mining Charter which was gazetted in June.

The Chamber is seeking for the Charter to be reviewed or set aside, arguing that the it would be harmful to the industry and the economy because of its content, as well as the vague and contradictory language employed to convey that content.

The Charter sets new black ownership targets for the industry, including that new mining rights holders have 30 percent black ownership shared among employees, communities and black entrepreneurs. The Chamber's application for review will be heard between December 13 and 14, at the High Court in Pretoria.

Hostility between the mining industry and the minister of mineral resources, Mosebenzi Zwane, is at its worst, culminating with the Chamber snubbing a gala dinner at which Zwane was the guest speaker on Tuesday night.

Speaking at the Joburg Indaba on Thursday about the contribution of the mining industry contribute to the South African economy, Mgojo said the Chamber remained committed to finding workable solutions in the national interest but no single grouping can do this alone.

"Chamber leaders are working hard at developing ideas on what a new charter could look like. We are engaging with past Chamber presidents who have been through the journey of Mining Charter one and two. We are talking to civil society organisations; we are talking to the unions; we are talking to political and government leaders," Mgojo said.

"We will be talking to other stakeholders like the Industrial Development Corporation, Public Investment Corporation, and others. We know that real consultation, engagements and partnerships are the key to a sensible transformation journey and outcomes. We also know that there remain many legacy issues with which we have to deal with."

Among the legacy issues, Mgojo said the Chamber was working on the challenge of unclaimed retirement fund payments, towards a settlement of silicosis claims, and dealing with a host of environmental issues relating to rehabilitation, to dust, to water, and so on.

Mgojo also said that the Chamber, a body which represents a significant portion of the mining industry, will hold government to account while ensuring that its own members' performance on governance is beyond reproach.

"We will hold our own members to account through our Chamber Membership compact, and ensure our own house is in order. At the same time, we will continue to call for ethical leadership and good governance in government, State-Owned Enterprises and in particular in the Department of Mineral Resources," Mgojo said.

"We will engage key stakeholders on this journey and where necessary turn to the courts to ensure outcomes that are in the national interest. As the leadership of the Chamber we have drawn a firm line in the sand regarding our opposition to unethical leadership, bad governance and state capture."

--------------------------------------------------- 
                  Financing Update 
--------------------------------------------------- 
 

Due to the reasons described in the Company's announcements dated 23 February 2017, 11 May 2017, 20 July 2017 and 13 September 2017, the Company's operations have been seriously hampered and have not produced the financial outcomes which management had hoped for and which the directors consider shareholders deserve. The ongoing overhead of the Company's listing costs are significant and are now disproportionate when weighed against the benefits that the listings on AIM and AltX bring to shareholders.

The Company has previously announced the seriousness of its financial position and this remains the case. The Company has debt commitments to Redstone Capital Limited and the Wang family, amounting to US$ 9.8 million in aggregate, which could be called at any time. Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries have trade and other creditors amounting to a further US$ 7.8 million in aggregate. Whilst Central Rand Gold South Africa Proprietary Limited's operations have stabilised operationally, the financial and operational positions remain fragile. There is a very thin working capital position at the operating company level with a negative position within the Company, as mentioned above. The Company's production for the period 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2017 was 2 320 Troy Ounces.

The Company's overall financial position is negative and the directors are now actively exploring urgent financing options. In order to remain a listed, operational mining group, in steady state and with a view to achieving medium-term profitability, the directors consider that a cash injection of not less than US$ 20 million would be required. The directors consider that this is very unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future or at all. Accordingly, the directors are actively pursuing options which would involve retaining its listings but will require the disposal of the Company's interests in its immediate subsidiary company, Central Rand Gold (Netherlands Antilles) NV, unless it is able to secure sufficient alternative finance at the required level in the very near future.

Central Rand Gold Ltd. (CRD.JO) said Thursday that it is pursuing the sale of its operations, estimating that it needs a cash injection of $20 million to remain an operational mining firm.

The company said it has debt commitments of $9.8 million which could be called at any time, and owes a further $7.8 million to trade and other creditors. Meanwhile, it has a thin working-capital position at its operating company level.

It said the directors are therefore exploring the disposal of Central Rand's immediate subsidiary, which holds a majority interest in its South African operations, unless it can secure sufficient alternative finance in the very near future.

Central Rand Gold said it will retain its junior market listings on the AIM in London and AltX in South Africa if it sells its operations.

Shares have been suspended since May.

Company is confident after doing the hard work of restructuring mines and getting assets to generate cash

Resources Writer

There is no question of Anglo American & cutting and running& from SA in 2018, with the century-old company plotting its future in the country and developing a strategy for mines at which the hard work to return them to profit has largely been done, says Norman Mbazima, deputy chairman of Anglo American SA.

Tasked with restructuring Anglo’s South African portfolio — which includes thermal coal mines for Eskom and export sales, iron ore, manganese, platinum group metals and diamonds — and defining the company’s identity in the country, Mbazima has overseen the R2.3bn sale to Seriti Resources of three coal mines that supply Eskom.

The next sale is likely to be the undeveloped New Largo colliery, which will also supply the state-owned power utility. Fewer than five contenders are bidding for the mine, one of which is Seriti. One of the most critical conditions in completing the sale of the collieries to Seriti, which will become the second-largest source of coal for Eskom, is Eskom’s transfer of the coal supply agreement from Anglo to the black-owned company.

Eskom has been dogged by management issues, with changes in the CE role and with its chief financial officer, Anoj Singh, suspended for his role in controversial deals involving the Gupta family, which is close to President Jacob Zuma. Former acting CE Matshela Koko faces disciplinary action.

Despite these ructions, Mbazima said he was confident Eskom would approve the transfer of the sales agreement to Seriti before the end of 2017.

Asked in an interview what gave him that confidence, he said: & The underlying deal can withstand any scrutiny…. My current experience with Eskom is an improving one. We have come from a more difficult area to a much better area.

& They’ve done a lot of their own clean-up and some people have been mandated to get on with things and we are making progress,& he said. When it came to considering what to do with the bulk mining assets in export coal, iron ore and manganese, Anglo was in a & much happier place& than it had been in 2015 when it began the process of selling assets to reduce its $13bn debt in a low point in the commodity cycle.

Prices had improved, the assets were generating cash and the restructuring of the mines had been largely completed, Mbazima said.

Anglo CEO Mark Cutifani said the company would make big decisions on its assets once the ANC had held its December conference and decided on the party’s presidency.

& Anglo is 100 years old. It was here before apartheid, through apartheid, it’s here now and it will be here through whatever it is now. We are not cutting and running. We have to have long-term strategies that recommit to this country. There is good money to be made in SA,& Mbazima said.

AWAITING PERMITS - De Beers suspends exploration budget

AWAITING PERMITS

De Beers suspends exploration budget

De Beers, which will be down to a single mine in SA from 2020, has 54 exploration applications stuck with the Department of Mineral Resources, some for two years, and has suspended its R40m annual exploration budget in the country.

The focus of De Beers Consolidated Mines (DBCM), the South African subsidiary of De Beers, the world’s largest producer of rough diamonds by value, was to bring its $2bn Venetia mine into production and manage the transition from opencast mining to underground mining, minimising the anticipated dip in production at that time, said DBCM CEO Phillip Barton.

While De Beers had patiently pushed for the exploration licences to be approved — having exhausted all its other exploration permits — it was now coming to a point where taking the Department of Mineral Resources to court was being considered as an option if talks with Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane yielded no progress, Barton said on the sidelines of the Joburg Indaba mining conference.

Zwane said at a gala dinner on Tuesday night, he and his department had an & open-door policy& for anyone with a problem to come speak to them. DBCM would put this to the test, Barton said.

The department’s third iteration of the now suspended Mining Charter said companies applying for exploration permits needed to be 51% black-owned. De Beers would not invest in projects in which it was the minority partner and had stopped the exploration budget for DBCM for 2017 and 2018 until it received the permits.

De Beers will close its Voorspoed mine in the Free State in early 2020, having decided the cost metrics at the operation, which started in 2008, no longer fitted the company’s profile.

There are resources left at the mine, but it would need an investment to expand the pit to reach fresh ore, an investment it was not willing to make.
